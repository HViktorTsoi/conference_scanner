abstract = {Urban traffic sensing has been investigated extensively by different real-time sensing approaches due to important applications such as navigation and emergency services. Basically, the existing traffic sensing approaches can be classified into two categories, i.e., explicit and implicit sensing. In this paper, we design a measurement framework called EXIMIUS for a large-scale data-driven study to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of these two sensing approaches by using two particular systems for traffic sensing as concrete examples, i.e., a vehicular system as a crowdsourcing-based explicit sensing and a cellular system as an infrastructure-based implicit sensing. In our investigation, we utilize TB-level data from two systems: (i) vehicle GPS data from 3 thousand private cars and 2 thousand commercial vehicles, (ii) cellular signaling data from 3 million cellphone users, from the Chinese city Hefei. Our study adopts a widely-used concept called crowdedness level to rigorously explore the impacts of various spatiotemporal contexts on real-time traffic conditions including population density, region functions, road categories, rush hours, etc. based on a wide range of context data. We quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these two sensing approaches in different scenarios then we explore the possibility of unifying these two sensing approaches for better performance. Our results provide a few valuable insights for urban sensing based on explicit and implicit data from transportation and telecommunication domains.},

abstract = {This paper introduces techniques to automatically detect driving corner cases from dashcam video and inertial sensors. Developing robust driver assistance and automated driving technologies requires an understanding of not just common highway and city traffic situations but also a plethora of corner cases that may be encountered in billions of miles of driving. Current approaches seek to collect such a catalog of corner cases by driving millions of miles with self-driving prototypes. In contrast, this paper introduces a low-cost yet scalable solution to collect such events from any dashcam-equipped vehicle to take advantage of the billions of miles that humans already drive. It detects unusual events through inertial sensing of sudden human driver reactions and rare visual events through a trained autoencoder deep neural network. We evaluate the system based on more than 120 hours real road driving data. It shows 82\% accuracy improvement versus strawman solutions for sudden reaction detection and above 71\% accuracy for rare visual views identification. The detection results proved useful for re-training and improving a self-steering algorithm on more complex situations. In terms of computational efficiency, the Android prototype achieves 17Hz frame rate (Nexus 5X).},

abstract = {Thanks to the adoption of more sensors in the automotive industry, context-aware Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) become possible. On one side, a common thread in ADAS applications is to focus entirely on the context of the vehicle and its surrounding vehicles leaving the human (driver) context out of consideration. On the other side, and due to the increasing sensing capabilities in mobile phones and wearable technologies, monitoring complex human context becomes feasible which paves the way to develop driver-in-the-loop context-aware ADAS that provide personalized driving experience. In this paper, we propose Sentio1; a Reinforcement Learning based algorithm to enhance the Forward Collision Warning (FCW) system leading to Driver-in-the-Loop FCW system. Since the human driving preference is unknown a priori, varies between different drivers, and moreover, varies across time for the same driver, the proposed Sentio algorithm needs to take into account all these variabilities which are not handled by the standard reinforcement learning algorithms. We verified the proposed algorithm against several human drivers. Our evaluation, across distracted human drivers, shows a significant enhancement in driver experience---compared to standard FCW systems---reflected by an increase in the driver safety by 94.28\%, an improvement in the driving experience by 20.97\%, a decrease in the false negatives from 55.90\% down to 3.26\%, while adding less than 130 ms runtime execution overhead.},

abstract = {Tiny energy harvesting battery-free devices promise maintenance free operation for decades, providing swarm scale intelligence in applications from healthcare to building monitoring. These devices operate intermittently because of unpredictable, dynamic energy harvesting environments, failing when energy is scarce. Despite this dynamic operation, current programming models are static; they ignore the event-driven and time-sensitive nature of sensing applications, focusing only on preserving forward progress while maintaining performance. This paper proposes InK; the first reactive kernel that provides a novel way to program these tiny energy harvesting devices that focuses on their main application of event-driven sensing. InK brings an event-driven paradigm shift for batteryless applications, introducing building blocks and abstractions that enable reacting to changes in available energy and variations in sensing data, alongside task scheduling, while maintaining a consistent memory and sense of time. We implemented several event-driven applications for InK, conducted a user study, and benchmarked InK against the state-of-the-art; InK provides up to 14 times more responsiveness and was easier to use. We show that InK enables never before seen batteryless applications, and facilitates more sophisticated batteryless programs.},

abstract = {We present CapBand, a battery-free hand gesture recognition wearable in the form of a wristband. The key challenges in creating such a system are (1) to sense useful hand gestures at ultra-low power so that the device can be powered by the limited energy harvestable from the surrounding environment and (2) to make the system work reliably without requiring training every time a user puts on the wristband. We present successive capacitance sensing, an ultra-low power sensing technique, to capture small skin deformations due to muscle and tendon movements on the user's wrist, which corresponds to specific groups of wrist muscles representing the gestures being performed. We build a wrist muscles-to-gesture model, based on which we develop a hand gesture classification method using both motion and static features. To eliminate the need for per-usage training, we propose a kernel-based on-wrist localization technique to detect the CapBand's position on the user's wrist. We prototype CapBand with a custom-designed capacitance sensor array on two flexible circuits driven by a custom-built electronic board, a heterogeneous material-made, deformable silicone band, and a custom-built energy harvesting and management module. Evaluations on 20 subjects show 95.0\% accuracy of gesture recognition when recognizing 15 different hand gestures and 95.3\% accuracy of on-wrist localization.},

abstract = {While malicious attacks on electronic devices (e-devices) have become commonplace, the use of e-devices themselves for malicious attacks has increased (e.g., explosives and eavesdropping). Modern e-devices (e.g., spy cameras, bugs or concealed weapons) can be sealed in parcels/boxes, hidden under clothing or disguised with cardboard to conceal their identities (named as hidden e-devices hereafter), which brings challenges in security screening. Inspection equipment (e.g., X-ray machines) is bulky and expensive. Moreover, screening reliability still rests on human performance, and the throughput in security screening of passengers and luggages is very limited. To this end, we propose to develop a low-cost and practical hidden e-device recognition technique to enable efficient screenings for threats of hidden electronic devices in daily life. First, we investigate and model the characteristics of nonlinear effects, a special passive response of electronic devices under millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing. Based on this theory and our preliminary experiments, we design and implement, E-Eye, an end-to-end portable hidden electronics recognition system. E-Eye comprises a low-cost (i.e., under $100), portable (i.e., 11.8cm by 4.5cm by 1.8cm) and light-weight (i.e., 45.5g) 24GHz mmWave probe and a smartphone-based e-device recognizer. To validate the E-Eye performance, we conduct experiments with 46 commodity electronic devices under 39 distinct categories. Results show that E-Eye can recognize hidden electronic devices in parcels/boxes with an accuracy of more than 99\% and has an equal error rate (EER) approaching 0.44\% under a controlled lab setup. Moreover, we evaluate the reliability, robustness and performance variation of E-Eye under various real-world circumstances, and E-Eye can still achieve accuracy over 97\%. Intensive evaluation indicates that E-Eye is a promising solution for hidden electronics recognition in daily life.},

abstract = {We are speeding toward a not-too-distant future when we can perform human-computer interaction using solely our voice. Speech recognition is the key technology that powers voice input, and it is usually outsourced to the cloud for the best performance. However, user privacy is at risk because voiceprints are directly exposed to the cloud, which gives rise to security issues such as spoof attacks on speaker authentication systems. Additionally, it may cause privacy issues as well, for instance, the speech content could be abused for user profiling. To address this unexplored problem, we propose to add an intermediary between users and the cloud, named VoiceMask, to anonymize speech data before sending it to the cloud for speech recognition. It aims to mitigate the security and privacy risks by concealing voiceprints from the cloud. VoiceMask is built upon voice conversion but is much more than that; it is resistant to two de-anonymization attacks and satisfies differential privacy. It performs anonymization in resource-limited mobile devices while still maintaining the usability of the cloud-based voice input service. We implement VoiceMask on Android and present extensive experimental results. The evaluation substantiates the efficacy of VoiceMask, e.g., it is able to reduce the chance of a user's voice being identified from 50 people by a mean of 84\%, while reducing voice input accuracy no more than 14.2\%.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the deployment of various types of sensors in the homes, offices, buildings, lawns, cities, and even in agricultural farms. Since IoT applications rely on the fidelity of data reported by the sensors, it is important to detect a faulty sensor and isolate the cause of the fault. Existing fault detection techniques demand sensor domain knowledge along with the contextual information and historical data from similar near-by sensors. However, detecting a sensor fault by analyzing just the sensor data is non-trivial since a faulty sensor reading could mimic non-faulty sensor data. This paper presents a novel primitive, which we call the Fall-curve - a sensor's voltage response when the power is turned off - that can be used to characterize sensor faults. The Fall-curve constitutes a unique signature independent of the phenomenon being monitored which can be used to identify the sensor and determine whether the sensor is correctly operating.We have empirically evaluated the Fall-curve technique on a wide variety of analog and digital sensors. We have also been running this system live in a few agricultural farms, with over 20 IoT devices. We were able to detect and isolate faults with an accuracy over 99\%, which would have otherwise been hard to detect only by observing measured sensor data.},

abstract = {The vision of tracking small IoT devices runs into the reality of localization technologies --- today it is difficult to continuously track objects through walls in homes and warehouses on a coin cell battery. While Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband radios can provide tracking through walls, they do not last more than a month on small coin and button cell batteries since they consume tens of milliwatts of power. We present the first localization system that consumes microwatts of power at a mobile device and can be localized across multiple rooms in settings like homes and hospitals. To this end, we introduce a multi-band backscatter prototype that operates across 900 MHz, 2.4 and 5 GHz and can extract the backscatter phase information from signals that are below the noise floor. We build sub-centimeter sized prototypes which consume 93 μW and could last five to ten years on button cell batteries. We achieved ranges of up to 60 m away from the AP and accuracies of 2, 12, 50 and 145 cm at 1, 5, 30 and 60 m respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our design, we deploy it in two real-world scenarios: five homes in a metropolitan area and the surgery wing of a hospital in patient pre-op and post-op rooms as well as storage facilities.},

abstract = {RF-based (mainly Wi-Fi and BLE) localization systems have been gaining the significant amount of attention from industry, since they do not require the deployment of any special and costly infrastructure such as cameras and depth sensors but leverage existing wireless Access Points (APs) and mobile clients. However, extensive field trials have shown that such solutions can be inaccurate (e.g., meter-level localization error) and/or impractical (e.g., requiring centrally-controlled, dense AP deployments). In this paper, we focus on millimeter-wave wireless networks, which are becoming increasingly popular for both indoors and outdoors connectivity, to overcome the aforementioned limitations and to provide accurate 3D localization. Specifically, we propose mWaveLoc, a system that exploits the small wavelength (millimeter) and directional communication of millimeter-wave (e.g., in 60 GHz) networks for accurate and practical 3D localization. mWaveLoc relies only on a single AP to track a device's position and works with existing off-the-shelf 802.11ad 60 GHz devices. Our implementation and experimental results on commodity 802.11ad testbeds show that mWaveLoc can achieve centimeter-level AP-client distance estimation accuracy and decimeter-level 3D localization accuracy in Line-Of-Sight settings.},

In this paper, we present SALMA, a novel low-cost UWB-based indoor localization system that makes use of only one anchor and that does neither require prior calibration nor training. By using only a crude floor plan and by exploiting multipath reflections, SALMA can accurately determine the position of a mobile tag using a single anchor, hence minimizing the infrastructure costs, as well as the setup time. We implement SALMA on off-the-shelf UWB devices based on the Decawave DW1000 transceiver and show that, by making use of multiple directional antennas, SALMA can also resolve ambiguities due to overlapping multipath components. An experimental evaluation in an office environment with clear line-of-sight has shown that 90\% of the position estimates obtained using SALMA exhibit less than 20 cm error, with a median below 8 cm. We further study the performance of SALMA in the presence of obstructed line-of-sight conditions, moving objects and furniture, as well as in highly dynamic environments with several people moving around, showing that the system can sustain decimeter-level accuracy with a worst-case average error below 34 cm.},

In IoT networks, to demonstrate even further ultra-low power consumption, we introduce Passive-ZigBee that demonstrates we can transform an existing productive WiFi signal into a ZigBee packet for a CoTS low-power consumption receiver while consuming 1,440 times lower power compared to traditional ZigBee. Moreover, this low power backscatter radio can bridge between the ZigBee and WiFi devices by relaying data allowing heterogenous radios to communicate with each other. We built a hardware prototype and implement these devices on a commodity ZigBee, WiFi, and an FPGA platform. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the backscattered WiFi packets can be decoded by CoTS ZigBee receivers over a distance of 55 meters in none-line-of-sight and with human movements. Our Passive-ZigBee can consume only 25μW when transferring sensor data and relay ZigBee and WiFi data compared to traditional ZigBee (36mW). Our FPGA synthesis tool demonstrated the extremely low power consumption.},

This paper presents G-Bee, a CTI avoidance technique that uniquely places ZigBee packet on the guard band of ongoing WiFi traffic, which effectively safeguards the packet from WiFi interference. Such design ensures reliable ZigBee communication even under saturated WiFi traffic where traditional ZigBee is considered inoperable. Technical highlight is in lighweight WiFi guard band capture mechanism using ZigBee PHY layer samples directly accessible in various commercial ZigBee chip. Another exclusive feature of G-Bee is spectrum-synchronized low duty cycling - by utilizing guard bands of periodic WiFi beacons, active slots are effectively synchronized to spectrum availability (i.e., guard band) for significant delay improvement. Extensive evaluations on our prototype system demonstrates G-Bee PRR over 95\% where legacy ZigBee drops to below 15\% under significant interference with hundreds WiFi users and reduction of low duty cycle delay by 87.5\%, all of which are achieved with a light computational overhead of 0.3\%.},

abstract = {The lightweight protocols and low-power radio technologies open up many opportunities to facilitate Internet-of-Things (IoT) into our daily life, while their minimalist design also makes IoT devices vulnerable to many active attacks due to the lack of sophisticated security protocols. Recent advances advocate the use of an antenna array to extract fine-grained physical-layer signatures to mitigate these active attacks. However, it adds burdens in terms of energy consumption and hardware cost that IoT devices cannot afford. To overcome this predicament, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that attaches battery-free backscatter tags to single-antenna devices to shield the system from active attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to intentionally create multi-path propagation signatures with the careful deployment of backscatter tags. These signatures can be used to construct a sensitive profile to identify the location of the signals' arrival, and thus detect the threat. We prototype ShieldScatter with USRPs and ambient backscatter tags to evaluate our system in various environments. The experimental results show that even when the attacker is located only 15 cm away from the legitimate device, ShieldScatter with merely three backscatter tags can mitigate 97\% of spoofing attack attempts while at the same time trigger false alarms on just 7\% of legitimate traffic.},

abstract = {Smart apparel with embedded sensors have the potential to revolutionize human behavior sensing by leveraging everyday clothing as the sensing substrate. However, existing textile-based sensing techniques rely on tight-fitting garments to obtain sufficient signal to noise, making it uncomfortable to wear and limiting the technology to niche applications like athletic performance monitoring.Our solution leverages functionalized fabric to measure the triboelectric charges induced by folding and compression of the textile itself, making it a more natural fit for everyday clothing. However, the large sensing surface of a functionalized textile also increases body-coupled noise and motion artifacts, and introduces new challenges in how we suppress noise to detect the weak triboelectric signal. We address these challenges using a combination of textile, electronics, and signal analysis-based innovations, and robustly sense joint motions by improving SNR and extracting highly discriminative features from the signal. Additionally, we demonstrate how the same sensor can be used to measure relative changes in skin moisture levels induced by sweating. Our design uses a simple-to-manufacture layered architecture that can be incorporated into any conventional, loosely worn textile. We show that the sensor has high performance in natural conditions by benchmarking the accuracy of sensing several kinematic metrics as well as sweat level. Additionally, we provide real-world performance evaluations across three application case studies including activity classification, perspiration measurements during exercise, and comfort level detection for HVAC systems.},

abstract = {With the omnipresence of computing devices in our daily lives, interests in ubiquitous computing interfaces have grown. In response to this, various studies have introduced on-surface input techniques which use the surfaces of surrounding objects as a touch interface. However, these methods are yet struggling to support ubiquitous interaction due to their dependency on specific hardware or environments. In this paper, we propose UbiTap, an input method that turns solid surfaces into a touch input space, through the use of sound (i.e., with microphones already present in the commodity devices). More specifically, we develop a novel touch localization technique which leverages the physical phenomenon, referred to as dispersion, a characteristic of sound as it travels through solid surfaces, so as to address challenges which limit existing acoustic-based solutions in terms of portability, accuracy, usability, robustness, and responsiveness. Our extensive experiments with a prototype of UbiTap show that we can support sub-centimeter accuracy on various surfaces with minor user calibration effort. In our experience with real-world users, UbiTap significantly improves usability and robustness, thus enabling the emergence of more exciting applications.},

abstract = {Accurate and continuous ammonia monitoring is important for laboratory animal studies and many other applications. Existing solutions are often expensive, inaccurate, or unsuitable for long-term monitoring. In this work, we propose a new ammonia monitoring approach that is low-power, automatic, accurate, and wireless.Our system uses metal oxide sensors which change their electrical resistance due to an induced reduction reaction with ammonia at high temperatures. Traditional methods infer the ammonia level by measuring the sensor's electrical resistance after it reaches equilibrium. Such a system consumes a significant amount of energy because reaching equilibrium requires heating the sensor for minutes. Our proposed approach does not wait for equilibrium, but tries to predict the resistance at equilibrium using the sensor's initial resistance response curve in a very short heating pulse (as short as 200ms). The prediction model is built on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.We built 38 prototype sensors and a home-grown gas flow system. In a 3-month in-lab testing period, we conducted extensive experiments and collected 13,770 measurements. Our model accurately predicts the equilibrium state resistance value, with an average error rate of 0.12\%. The final average estimation error for the ammonia concentration level is 9.38ppm. Given the ultra low power consumption and accurate measurements, we have partnered with cage vendors and deployed our system at two animal research facilities (NIH and Cornell University) for month-long medical trials.},

However, it also introduces opportunities for conducting radio frequency (RF) sensing using pervasively available signals generated by heterogeneous IoT devices. In this paper, we explore how to leverage the ambient wireless traffic that i) generated by uncontrollable IoT devices and ii sensed by ambient noise floor measurements (a widely available metric in IoT devices) for human gesture recognition. Specifically, we introduce our system EAR, which can conduct fine-grained human gesture recognition using coarse-grained measurements (i.e., noise floor) of ambient RF signals generated from uncontrollable signal sources. We conducted extensive evaluations in both residential and academic buildings. Experimental results show that although EAR uses coarse-grained noise floor measurements to sense the uncontrollable signal sources, the signal sources can be distinguished with an accuracy up to 99.76\%. Moreover, EAR can recognize fine-grained human gestures with high accuracy even under extremely low traffic rate (i.e., 4\%) from uncontrollable ambient signal sources.},

abstract = {This paper presents CapeVM, a sensor node virtual machine aimed at delivering both high performance and a sandboxed execution environment that ensures malicious code cannot corrupt the VM's internal state or perform actions not allowed by the VM. CapeVM uses Ahead-of-Time compilation and introduces a range of optimisations to eliminate most of the overhead present in previous work on sensor node AOT compilers. A sandboxed execution environment is guaranteed by a set of checks. The structured nature of the VM's instruction set allows the VM to perform most checks at load time, reducing the need for expensive run-time checks compared to native code approaches.While some overhead from using a VM and adding sandbox checks cannot be avoided, CapeVM's optimisations reduce this overhead dramatically. We evaluate CapeVM using a set of IoT applications and show this results in a performance just 2.1x slower than unsandboxed native code. Thus, CapeVM combines the desirable properties ofexisting work on both sandboxed execution and virtual machines for sensor nodes, with significantly improved performance.},

abstract = {The emergence of low-power 32-bit Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), which integrate a 32-bit MCU, radio, and flash, presents an opportunity to re-examine design points and trade-offs at all levels of the system architecture of networked sensors. To this end, we develop a post-SoC/32-bit design point called Hamilton, showing that using integrated components enables a ~$7 core and shifts hardware modularity to design time. We study the interaction between hardware and embedded operating systems, identifying that (1) post-SoC motes provide lower idle current (5.9 μA) than traditional 16-bit motes, (2) 32-bit MCUs are a major energy consumer (e.g., tick increases idle current >50 times), comparable to radios, and (3) thread-based concurrency is viable, requiring only 8.3 μs of context switch time. We design a system architecture, based on a tickless multithreading operating system, with cooperative/adaptive clocking, advanced sensor abstraction, and preemptive packet processing. Its efficient MCU control improves concurrency with ~30\% less energy consumption. Together, these developments set the system architecture for networked sensors in a new direction.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks show great potential as solutions to many sensing application problems, but their excessive resource demand slows down execution time, pausing a serious impediment to deployment on low-end devices. To address this challenge, recent literature focused on compressing neural network size to improve performance. We show that changing neural network size does not proportionally affect performance attributes of interest, such as execution time. Rather, extreme run-time nonlinearities exist over the network configuration space. Hence, we propose a novel framework, called FastDeepIoT, that uncovers the non-linear relation between neural network structure and execution time, then exploits that understanding to find network configurations that significantly improve the trade-off between execution time and accuracy on mobile and embedded devices. FastDeepIoT makes two key contributions. First, FastDeepIoT automatically learns an accurate and highly interpretable execution time model for deep neural networks on the target device. This is done without prior knowledge of either the hardware specifications or the detailed implementation of the used deep learning library. Second, FastDeepIoT informs a compression algorithm how to minimize execution time on the profiled device without impacting accuracy. We evaluate FastDeepIoT using three different sensing-related tasks on two mobile devices: Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus. FastDeepIoT further reduces the neural network execution time by 48\% to 78\% and energy consumption by 37\% to 69\% compared with the state-of-the-art compression algorithms.},

In contrast to conventional MAR systems, which recognize objects using image-based computations performed in the cloud, MARVEL mainly utilizes a mobile device's local inertial sensors for recognizing and tracking multiple objects, while computing local optical flow and offloading images only when necessary. We propose a system architecture which uses local inertial tracking, local optical flow, and visual tracking in the cloud synergistically. On top of that, we investigate how to minimize the overhead for image computation and offloading. We have implemented and deployed a holistic prototype system in a commercial building and evaluate MARVEL's performance. The efficient use of a mobile device's capabilities lowers latency and energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy.},

abstract = {When Telecommunication (Telco) networks provide phone call and data services for mobile users, measurement record (MR) data is generated by mobile devices during each call/session. MR data reports the connection states, e.g., signal strength, between mobile devices and nearby base stations. Given the MR data, the literature has proposed various Telco localization approaches, to localize mobile devices. Unfortunately, such approaches typically estimate the individual position independently, and could compromise the temporal and spatial locality in underlying mobility patterns. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based localization approach, namely RecuLSTM, to automatically extract contextual features and predict the positions of mobile devices from an input sequence of MR data. Our preliminary experiment validates that RecuLSTM greatly outperforms three recent works [1, 2, 4] which suffer from 3.2\texttimes{}, 1.91\texttimes{} and 3.56\texttimes{} median errors on the dataset in a 2G GSM suburban area, respectively.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that it is possible for two wearable devices worn by the same user to generate a common key for secure pairing by exploiting gait as a common secret. A key challenge for such device pairing lies in matching the bits of the keys generated by two independent devices despite the noisy on-board sensor measurements. We propose a novel machine learning framework that uses an autoencoder to help one device predict the sensor observations at another device and generate the key using the predicted sensor data. We prototype the proposed method and evaluate it using real subjects. Our results show that the proposed method achieves a 10\% increase in bit agreement rate between two keys generated independently by two different wearable devices.},

abstract = {Location-aware mobile crowdsourcing tasks like urban sensing always require exposing users' location, which lead to serious privacy breaches. In this poster, we propose a locally differentially private participants recruitment system to maximize spatial coverage of the mobile crowdsourcing task while preserving location privacy. Based on the mechanism of randomized response, our system preserves the privacy in a local way, which eliminates the need for a trusted server. With guaranteed location privacy protection, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum spatial coverage problem efficiently given the obfuscated reports. Extensive experiments on real-world user trajectories demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed system, which improves the spatial coverage by more than 10\% on average compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.},

However, this approach requires high network bandwidth usage to collect a large amount of ADC samples from each gateway, which results in network congestion and high financial cost due to Internet data usage between the gateway and the Cloud server. In order to reduce the bandwidth usage of this data offloading operation, we propose a LPWAN packet acquisition mechanism based on joint sparse approximation.},

Therefore, it is especially important to thoroughly test and profile the systems before deploying to the real world. Traditional debugging methods are incompetent for detailed tracing on resource constrained devices due to their intrusiveness. This paper proposes a low-cost Hardware Assisted Tracing testBED (HATBED) to enable non-intrusive tracing and profiling for embedded networked sensor systems independent of operating systems and applications. We hope HATBED will foster research on comprehensive testing and profiling of embedded networked systems based on modern 32-bit architecture.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are being successfully used for the monitoring of large-scale systems that are delay-tolerant and which have low-bandwidth requirements. The next step would be instrumenting these for the control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) distributed over large areas which require more bandwidth, bounded delays and higher reliability or at least more rigorous guarantees therein. This paper presents LPWA-MAC, a novel Low Power Wide-Area network MAC protocol, that ensures bounded end-to-end delays, high channel utility and supports many of the different traffic patterns and data-rates typical of CPS.},

abstract = {Speech unlocks the huge potentials in emotion recognition. High accurate and real-time understanding of human emotion via speech assists Human-Computer Interaction. Previous works are often limited in either coarse-grained emotion learning tasks or the low precisions on the emotion recognition. To solve these problems, we construct a real-world large-scale corpus composed of 4 common emotions (i.e., anger, happiness, neutral and sadness). We also propose a multi-task attention-based DNN model (i.e., MT-A-DNN) on the emotion learning. MT-A-DNN efficiently learns the high-order dependency and non-linear correlations underlying in the audio data. Extensive experiments show that MT-A-DNN outperforms conventional methods on the emotion recognition. It could take one step further on the real-time acoustic emotion recognition in many smart audio-devices.},

We propose SleeP-Manager, a wearable embedded system, that is designed to aid Sleep Positional Therapy (SPT). SleeP-Manager with two wristbands monitors the sleep position of the user and gives a vibration feedback when a poor position is detected. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of SleeP-Manager. In order to accomplish this, an additional device of chestband is designed. The chestband provides the true sleep position and also measures the response of users to the vibration feedback. The results indicate that the accuracy of sleep position detection higher than 80\%, and the ratio of desired sleep position per night increased significantly by the use of SleeP-Manager. Our questionnaire survey shows the wristband-typed device is most preferred for SPT due to the cost-effectiveness, easy-to-wear, and practicality.},

With aims to promote improved health, healthcare companies are incentivizing their customers with the amount of exercise that is performed and using readings from wearable devices as a way of proving that the individual met the requirements. However, these devices have a risk of user spoofing attacks as an unauthorized individual can utilize the system. To prevent misuse of the product to gain reward and ultimately promote daily exercise for various types of exercise reward systems, we propose a biometric gait identification approach using a smart earring that we design and develop. In this paper, we preliminary train and test the gait identification system by utilizing a transfer learning, which shows a 100\% classification performance for eight participants.

We demonstrate bTracked, a field deployable tracking system for mobile BLE device bearers using BLE beacon signals. In particular, we exploit, not only range estimations but also pose of the BLE device bearer for tracking. Together with a particle filter and the concept of generic sensor models for generalized indoor environments, we present an online and real-time tracking application of persons.

Their use as data collection and power delivery agents can overcome challenges such as poor communications reliability in difficult RF environments and maintenance in areas dangerous for human operatives. Aerial interaction with wireless sensors presents some interesting new challenges, including selecting or designing appropriate communications protocols that must account for unique practicalities like the effects of velocity and altitude. This poster presents a practical evaluation of the effects of altitude when collecting sensor data using an unmanned aerial vehicle. We show that for an otherwise disconnected link over a long distance (70m), by increasing altitude (5m) the link is created and its signal strength continues to improve over tens of metres. This has interesting implications for protocol design and optimal aerial route planning.},

Due to the diverse nature of IoT deployments and the likelihood of sensor failures in-the-wild, a key challenge in the design of IoT systems is ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and fidelity of sensor data.We present a system based on the Fall-curve primitive -- a sensor's voltage response when the power is turned off -- to characterize the sensor. A sensor's Fall-curve constitutes a unique signature using which it is possible to identify the sensor and also detect whether it is operating correctly or not. In this demo, we show Fall-curve in action to accurately detect and identify the sensors connected to an IoT device. Furthermore, we also show that Fall-curves can reliably detect various transient and permanent sensor faults in an IoT device.},

Although facial recognition, especially through the use of deep neural networks, has achieved stellar performance over large datasets, the majority of approaches require supervised learning, that is, to be trained with tens or hundreds of images of users in different poses and lighting conditions. In this paper, we motivate that this enrollment effort is unnecessary if the smart-space has access to a wireless identifier e.g., through a smart-phone's MAC address. By learning and refining the noisy and weak association between a user's smart-phone and facial images, AutoTune can fine-tune a deep neural network to tailor it to the environment, users and conditions of a particular camera or set of cameras.},

abstract = {Target material identification is playing an important role in our everyday life. This paper introduces a device-free target material identification system, implemented on ubiquitous and cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. The intuition is that different materials produce different amounts of phase and amplitude changes when a target appears on the line-of-sight (LoS) of a radio frequency (RF) link. However, due to multipath and hardware imperfection, the measured phase and amplitude of the channel state information (CSI) are very noisy. We thus present novel CSI pre-processing schemes to address the multipath and hardware noise issues before they can be used for accurate material sensing. Comprehensive real-life experiments demonstrate that we can identify 10 commonly seen liquids at an overall accuracy higher than 95\% with strong multipath indoors.},

In the meantime, the future next 5 generation (5G) radio base stations (BS) are granted more capabilities. Distributed cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is becoming available for the future massive WSN. However, real-world distributed C-RAN is less explored for low-end IoT based WSN due to its difficulties in implementation. In this paper, we built a distributed C-RAN which has tens of distributed radio frontends using USRP N210s in a 20 \texttimes{} 20 \texttimes{} 3 m3 area. By exploiting the inherent hardware properties of low-end IoT devices and the spatial diversity of distributed C-RAN system, we show the distributed C-RAN can potentially decode collided signals from low-end IoT devices with all signal processing been done on the cloud.},

Although recent deep learning systems can achieve satisfactory tracking performance, they incur significant compute overhead, which prevents them from wide adoption on resource-constrained IoT platforms. In this demonstration, we present an Edge Computing system for Real-time object Tracking (ECRT) for resource-constrained devices. The key feature of our system is that it intelligently partitions compute-intensive tasks such as inferencing a convolutional neural network(CNN) into two parts, which are executed locally on an IoT device and/or on the edge server. Moreover, ECRT can minimize the power consumption of IoT devices while taking into consideration the dynamic network environment and user requirement on end to end delay.},

abstract = {In this paper we address configuration and management issues of smart homes. Current platforms requires the user to deal with several management inconvenience problems, such as increasing devices, operating between devices, and using new devices. From a user perspective, system configuration and management are major issues: ordinary consumers want to use systems performing minimal configuration. To address this issue, we propose a platform, composed of a web application and Software Defined Network (SDN). While the user interacts with an easy-to-use interface on a smart device, the app automatically generates and installs SDN rules. Our platform, besides facilitating configuration and management, results more efficient --- up to 4 times faster --- and reliable --- able to operate even in case of no connection with the cloud --- than current solutions.},

In our evaluation, we compare PreCount with state-of-art methods using the normalized root mean squared error metric (NRMSE) with datasets from four building cases. The obtained evaluation results using ground truth data indicates that PreCount can achieve an error reduction of 68\% when compared to raw counts and state-of-art methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents the implementation of a bicycle trip counter, which measures cycling speed, traveled distance, and cycling time, that is directly powered from tiny periodic pulses of energy with only the intrinsically present decoupling capacitance as an energy buffer. To cope with the highly variable amount of energy generated during each pulse, an energy-driven approach is used. The core principles in this approach are to dynamically adjust operational mode according to energy availability, to scale performance, for example sensing accuracy, proportional to energy harvested, and to perform intermittent or transient computing to enable computation across multiple power cycles. The device presented is able to start operation from energy supply pulses as low as 4 uJ, where a rough estimate of the sensing parameters is done, and perform increasingly complex and time-consuming tasks such as additional more accurate measurements, sensor fusion, and filtering computations as more energy becomes available.},

However, it still suffers from problems such as lack of data and high system uncertainty. This is because that the data amount and distribution vary over time. To address the problems, this paper combines two classic data driven models -- Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). We adopt the Random Forest Algorithm (RF) to adaptively choose the more accurate models (Kriging or IDW) according to the features we extracted. The experiment based on real world testbed shows our adaptive method achieves up to 30.6\% error reduction.},

abstract = {Indoor localization systems cannot rely on the same mechanisms, like GPS, that are used for outdoor or large-scale localization. Instead, autonomous or user-carried devices are often localized by measuring the time taken for an emitted signal to reach a known location; this signal can be sound, light, radio waves, or another similar sensed quantity. Autonomous mobile devices already contain motors, which produce sounds as a side effect of their operation, and so can potentially be included in a localization scheme without new hardware. In this paper, we briefly outline the challenges that need to be met for accurate detection and identification of motor-produced signals. We present a method for improving signal resolution for linear chirps that improves cross-correlation based signal detection by up to 2.8X.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a system that takes radio frequency (RF) signals from an off-the-shelf, low-cost, 77 GHz mm Wave radar and produces an enhanced 3D RF representation of a scene. Such a system can be used in scenarios where camera and other types of sensors do not work, or their performance is impacted due to bad lighting conditions and occlusions, or an alternate RF sensing system like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is too large, inconvenient, and costly. The enhanced RF representation can be used in numerous applications such as robot navigation, human-computer interaction, and patient monitoring. We use off-the-shelf parts to capture RF signals and collect our own data set for training and testing of the approach. The novelty of the system lies in its use of AI to generate a fine-grained 3D representation of an RF scene from its sparse RF representation which a mm Wave radar of the same class cannot achieve.},

By plugging a 64Key device in one's mobile device USB port, an independent network is created on the fly, which users access from their own device though a web-based interface. In addition to default apps such as chat, file sharing, and collaborative text editing, 64Key's functionality may be extended through the run-time installation of third-party apps, available at a public app store.

We use a convolutional long-short term memory structure in the generative model and train it with the scattered observations from mobile sensing. Evaluations on synthesized data and a deployment in the city of Tianjin show that our algorithm accurately captures fine-grained PM2.5 pollution patterns and changes.

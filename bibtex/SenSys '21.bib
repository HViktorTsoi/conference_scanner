abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an emerging class of real-time applications, e.g., autonomous driving, in which resource-constrained edge platforms need to execute a set of real-time mixed Deep Learning (DL) tasks concurrently. Such an application paradigm poses major challenges due to the huge compute workload of deep neural network models, diverse performance requirements of different tasks, and the lack of real-time support from existing DL frameworks. In this paper, we present RT-mDL, a novel framework to support mixed real-time DL tasks on edge platform with heterogeneous CPU and GPU resource. RT-mDL aims to optimize the mixed DL task execution to meet their diverse real-time/accuracy requirements by exploiting unique compute characteristics of DL tasks. RT-mDL employs a novel storage-bounded model scaling method to generate a series of model variants, and systematically optimizes the DL task execution by joint model variants selection and task priority assignment. To improve the CPU/GPU utilization of mixed DL tasks, RT-mDL also includes a new priority-based scheduler which employs a GPU packing mechanism and executes the CPU/GPU tasks independently. Our implementation on an F1/10 autonomous driving testbed shows that, RT-mDL can enable multiple concurrent DL tasks to achieve satisfactory real-time performance in traffic light detection and sign recognition. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, RT-mDL can reduce deadline missing rate by 40.12\% while only sacrificing 1.7\% model accuracy.},

abstract = {Deep learning has been increasingly applied to improve human activity recognition (HAR) accuracy and reduce the human efforts of handcrafted feature extractions. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning paradigm that enables the collaborative learning of a global model without exposing users' raw data. However, existing FL approaches yield unsatisfactory HAR performance as they fail to dynamically aggregate models according to the statistical diversity of users' data. In this paper, we propose FedDL, a novel federated learning system for HAR that can capture the underlying user relationships and apply them to learn personalized models for different users dynamically. Specifically, we design a dynamic layer sharing scheme that learns the similarity among users' model weights to form the sharing structure and merges models accordingly in an iterative, bottom-up layer-wise manner. FedDL merges local models based on the dynamic sharing scheme, significantly speeding up the convergence while maintaining high accuracy. We have implemented FedDL and evaluated using a new data set we collected using LiDAR and four public real-world datasets involving 178 users in total. The results show that FedDL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL paradigms in terms of model accuracy (by more than 15\%), converging rate (by more than 70\%), and communication overhead (about 30\% reduction). Moreover, the testing results on the datasets of different scales show that FedDL has high scalability and hence can be deployed for large-scale real-world applications.},

abstract = {As intelligence is moving from data centers to the edges, intelligent edge devices such as smartphones, drones, robots, and smart IoT devices are equipped with the capability to altogether train a deep learning model on the devices from the data collected by themselves. Despite its considerable value, the key bottleneck of making on-device distributed training practically useful in real-world deployments is that they consume a significant amount of training time under wireless networks with constrained bandwidth. To tackle this critical bottleneck, we present Mercury, an importance sampling-based framework that enhances the training efficiency of on-device distributed training without compromising the accuracies of the trained models. The key idea behind the design of Mercury is to focus on samples that provide more important information in each training iteration. In doing this, the training efficiency of each iteration is improved. As such, the total number of iterations can be considerably reduced so as to speed up the overall training process. We implemented Mercury and deployed it on a self-developed testbed. We demonstrate its effectiveness and show that Mercury consistently outperforms two status quo frameworks on six commonly used datasets across tasks in image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNN) enabled various mobile deep learning applications. However, it is technically challenging to locally train a DNN model due to limited data on devices like mobile phones. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which allows for model training on decentralized data residing on devices without breaching data privacy. Hence, FL becomes a natural choice for deploying on-device deep learning applications. However, the data residing across devices is intrinsically statistically heterogeneous (i.e., non-IID data distribution) and mobile devices usually have limited communication bandwidth to transfer local updates. Such statistical heterogeneity and communication bandwidth limit are two major bottlenecks that hinder applying FL in practice. In addition, considering mobile devices usually have limited computational resources, improving computation efficiency of training and running DNNs is critical to developing on-device deep learning applications. In this paper, we present FedMask - a communication and computation efficient FL framework. By applying FedMask, each device can learn a personalized and structured sparse DNN, which can run efficiently on devices. To achieve this, each device learns a sparse binary mask (i.e., 1 bit per network parameter) while keeping the parameters of each local model unchanged; only these binary masks will be communicated between the server and the devices. Instead of learning a shared global model in classic FL, each device obtains a personalized and structured sparse model that is composed by applying the learned binary mask to the fixed parameters of the local model. Our experiments show that compared with status quo approaches, FedMask improves the inference accuracy by 28.47\% and reduces the communication cost and the computation cost by 34.48X and 2.44X. FedMask also achieves 1.56X inference speedup and reduces the energy consumption by 1.78X.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm marked by low-power and long-distance communication. Among them, LoRa is widely deployed for its unique characteristics and open-source technology. By adopting the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, LoRa enables low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. However, the standard demodulation method does not fully exploit the properties of chirp signals, thus yields a sub-optimal SNR threshold under which the decoding fails. Consequently, the communication range and energy consumption have to be compromised for robust transmission. This paper presents NELoRa, a neural-enhanced LoRa demodulation method, exploiting the feature abstraction ability of deep learning to support ultra-low SNR LoRa communication. Taking the spectrogram of both amplitude and phase as input, we first design a mask-enabled Deep Neural Network (DNN) filter that extracts multi-dimension features to capture clean chirp symbols. Second, we develop a spectrogram-based DNN decoder to decode these chirp symbols accurately. Finally, we propose a generic packet demodulation system by incorporating a method that generates high-quality chirp symbols from received signals. We implement and evaluate NELoRa on both indoor and campus-scale outdoor testbeds. The results show that NELoRa achieves 1.84-2.35 dB SNR gains and extends the battery life up to 272\% (~0.38-1.51 years) in average for various LoRa configurations.},

abstract = {Realizing the vision of ubiquitous battery-free sensing has proven to be challenging, mainly due to the practical energy and range limitations of current wireless communication systems. To address this, we design the first wide-area and scalable backscatter network with multiple receivers (RX) and transmitters (TX) base units to communicate with battery-free sensor nodes. Our system circumvents the inherent limitations of backscatter systems -including the limited coverage area, frequency-dependent operability, and sensor node limitations in handling network tasks- by introducing several coordination techniques between the base units starting from a single RX-TX pair to networks with many RX and TX units.We build low-cost RX and TX base units and battery-free sensor nodes with multiple sensing modalities and evaluate the performance of the MultiScatter system in various deployments. Our evaluation shows that we can successfully communicate with battery-free sensor nodes across 23400 ft2 of a two-floor educational complex using 5 RX and 20 TX units, costing $569. Also, we show that the aggregated throughput of the backscatter network increases linearly as the number of RX units and the network coverage grows.},

abstract = {Advances in flexible conductive substrates such as conductive wallpaper and paint present new opportunities for optimizing the performance of IoT nodes in smart homes and buildings. In this paper, we explore an unconventional use of such substrates for pulling frequencies of oscillators across IoT devices and wireless front-ends connected to the substrate. We show that by using this technique, we can replace precise crystal oscillators by lower precision and lower cost ceramic oscillators without compromising their ability to be used for tasks that require precise frequencies such as frequency-synchronized multi-static backscatter and synchronized sampling. We present an end-to-end design including a) analysis of conditions under which frequency pulling of oscillators across conductive substrates can work, b) a new technique to detect frequency locking across oscillators without requiring explicit communication, and c) an adaptive method that can be used to synchronize oscillators at minimum power consumption. We then show that these elements can be composed to design a high-performance multi-static backscatter system that performs as well as one that uses a shared high-precision clock but at an order of magnitude less monetary cost. We show that our system can scale and operate at very low power, while having low complexity since it requires no explicit interaction among devices attached to the substrate.},

abstract = {With the advance in automatic speech recognition, voice user interface has gained popularity recently. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, VUI is increasingly preferred in online communication due to its non-contact. Additionally, various ambient noise impedes the public applications of voice user interfaces due to the requirement of audio-only speech recognition methods for a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we present Wavoice, the first noise-resistant multi-modal speech recognition system that fuses two distinct voice sensing modalities, i.e., millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and audio signals from a microphone, together. One key contribution is that we model the inherent correlation between mmWave and audio signals. Based on it, Wavoice facilitates the real-time noise-resistant voice activity detection and user targeting from multiple speakers. Furthermore, we elaborate on two novel modules into the neural attention mechanism for multi-modal signals fusion, and result in accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments verify Wavoice's effectiveness under various conditions with the character recognition error rate below 1\% in a range of 7 meters. Wavoice outperforms existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error rate and word error rate. The evaluation in complex scenes validates the robustness of Wavoice.},

abstract = {Crucial for healthcare and biomedical applications, respiration monitoring often employs wearable sensors in practice, causing inconvenience due to their direct contact with human bodies. Therefore, researchers have been constantly searching for contact-free alternatives. Nonetheless, existing contact-free designs mostly require human subjects to remain static, largely confining their adoptions in everyday environments where body movements are inevitable. Fortunately, radio-frequency (RF) enabled contact-free sensing, though suffering motion interference inseparable by conventional filtering, may offer a potential to distill respiratory waveform with the help of deep learning. To realize this potential, we introduce MoRe-Fi to conduct fine-grained respiration monitoring under body movements. MoRe-Fi leverages an IR-UWB radar to achieve contact-free sensing, and it fully exploits the complex radar signal for data augmentation. The core of MoRe-Fi is a novel variational encoder-decoder network; it aims to single out the respiratory waveforms that are modulated by body movements in a non-linear manner. Our experiments with 12 subjects and 66-hour data demonstrate that MoRe-Fi accurately recovers respiratory waveform despite the interference caused by body movements. We also discuss potential applications of MoRe-Fi for pulmonary disease diagnoses.},

By utilizing the ON-OFF-Keying modulated backscatter signals, Palantir can perform fine-grained long-range cyclist sensing. Our findings show that sensing is more susceptible to channel quality than communication. Hence, the design of Palantir particularly addresses the critical challenges of signal processing, such as amplitude instability, frequency offset, clock drift, spectrum leakage, and multiplicative noise. We implement Palantir and evaluate its performance by conducting comprehensive benchmark experiments. A prototype is also built and a case study of respiration monitoring in the real world is implemented. Results demonstrate that Palantir can perform accurate sensing at a range up to 100 m, which is twice that of state-of-the-art approaches. The median deviation of the detected motion period is as low as 0.2\%.},

abstract = {Besides the communication function, wireless signals are recently exploited for sensing purposes, enabling diverse applications. However, designing a wireless sensing system that provides truly pervasive coverage at city or even national scale and at the same time does not affect ongoing data communication is still challenging. In this work, we propose to involve the pervasive LTE signals into the ecosystem of wireless sensing. Although LTE sensing solves the coverage issue and does not compromise the communication function, it brings unique challenges. Due to the long distance between LTE base stations and terminals, the LTE signal interacts with diverse objects during the propagation process which causes severe interference in sensing. We enable LTE sensing by designing delicate signal processing schemes to combat against the severe interference. We demonstrate the advantages of LTE sensing using two typical applications, indoor respiration sensing and outdoor traffic monitoring. Extensive experiments show that the proposed system can achieve highly accurate respiration sensing with the blind spot and orientation-sensitive issues greatly mitigated. For traffic monitoring, the error of car speed estimation is lower than 2 mph, as good as commercial devices on the market.},

abstract = {This paper presents CurveLight, an accurate and practical light positioning system. In CurveLight, the signal transmitter includes an infrared LED, covered by a hemispherical and rotatable shade, and the receiver detects the light signals with a photosensitive diode. When the shade is rotating, the transmitter generates a unique sequence of light signals for each point in the covered space. The main novelty of the system design is a set of curves that define different regions, either transparent or translucent, on the shade. The regions allow the light signals to create patterns from which the receiver can calculate its angles with respect to the transmitter. We design the curves in such a way that the angular information is most robust to errors caused by signal noise and motor jitters. Moreover, the shade is divided into multiple sectors, each providing independent positioning function, so as to maximize the position update rate. Experiments in various environments show that the system achieves 2-3 cm accuracy on average, with a 36 Hz update rate with a single transmitter. We present a product quality implementation of the system, and report the deployment experience in real-world environments, including autonomous driving and robotics navigation. CurveLight consistently offers centimeter-level accuracy and low latency, serving as a key component of the hybrid navigation solution for real systems in challenging scenarios.},

This is beneficial for applications with long deployments on battery such as wildlife tracking. However, only a few snapshot GNSS implementations have been presented so far and all have disadvantages. Most significantly, they typically require the GNSS signals to be captured with a certain minimum resolution, which demands complex receiver hardware capable of capturing multi-bit data at sampling rates of 16 MHz and more. By contrast, we develop fast algorithms that reliably estimate locations from twelve-millisecond signals that are sampled at just 4 MHz and quantised with only a single bit per sample. This allows us to build a snapshot receiver at an unmatched low cost of $14, which can acquire one position per hour for a year. On a challenging public dataset with thousands of snapshots from real-world scenarios, our system achieves 97\% reliability and 11 m median accuracy, comparable to existing solutions with more complex and expensive hardware and higher energy consumption. We provide an open implementation of the algorithms as well as a public web service for cloud-based location estimation from low-quality GNSS signal snapshots.},

abstract = {Backscattering tags transmit passively without an on-board active radio transmitter. Almost all present-day backscatter systems, however, rely on active radio receivers. This presents a significant scalability, power and cost challenge for backscatter systems. To overcome this barrier, recent research has empowered these passive tags with the ability to reliably receive backscatter signals from other tags. This forms the building block of passive networks wherein tags talk to each other without an active radio on either the transmit or receive side. For wider functionality, accurate localization of such tags is critical. All known backscatter tag localization techniques rely on active receivers for measuring and characterizing the received signal. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to passive tag-to-tag networks. This paper overcomes the gap by developing a localization technique for such passive networks based on a novel method for phase-based ranging in passive receivers. This method allows pairs of passive tags to collaboratively determine the inter-tag channel phase while effectively minimizing the effects of multipath and noise in the surrounding environment. Building on this, we develop a localization technique that benefits from large link diversity uniquely available in a passive tag-to-tag network. We evaluate the performance of our techniques with extensive micro-benchmarking experiments in an indoor environment using fabricated prototypes of tag hardware. We show that our phase-based ranging performs similar to active receivers, providing median 1D ranging error <1 cm and median localization error also <1 cm. Benefiting from the large-scale link diversity our localization technique outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques that use active receivers.},

abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of RFusion, a robotic system that can search for and retrieve RFID-tagged items in line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight, and fully-occluded settings. RFusion consists of a robotic arm that has a camera and antenna strapped around its gripper. Our design introduces two key innovations: the first is a method that geometrically fuses RF and visual information to reduce uncertainty about the target object's location, even when the item is fully occluded. The second is a novel reinforcement-learning network that uses the fused RF-visual information to efficiently localize, maneuver toward, and grasp target items. We built an end-to-end prototype of RFusion and tested it in challenging real-world environments. Our evaluation demonstrates that RFusion localizes target items with centimeter-scale accuracy and achieves 96\% success rate in retrieving fully occluded objects, even if they are under a pile. The system paves the way for novel robotic retrieval tasks in complex environments such as warehouses, manufacturing plants, and smart homes.},

abstract = {WiFi-based Human Gesture Recognition (HGR) becomes increasingly promising for device-free human-computer interaction. However, existing WiFi-based approaches have not been ready for real-world deployment due to the limited scalability, especially for unseen gestures. The reason behind is that when introducing unseen gestures, prior works have to collect a large number of samples and re-train the model. While the recent advance of few-shot learning has brought new opportunities to solve this problem, the overhead has not been effectively reduced. This is because these methods still require enormous data to learn adequate prior knowledge, and their complicated training process intensifies the regular training cost. In this paper, we propose a WiFi-based HGR system, namely OneFi, which can recognize unseen gestures with only one (or few) labeled samples. OneFi fundamentally addresses the challenge of high overhead. On the one hand, OneFi utilizes a virtual gesture generation mechanism such that the massive efforts in prior works can be significantly alleviated in the data collection process. On the other hand, OneFi employs a lightweight one-shot learning framework based on transductive fine-tuning to eliminate model re-training. We additionally design a self-attention based backbone, termed as WiFi Transformer, to minimize the training cost of the proposed framework. We establish a real-world testbed using commodity WiFi devices and perform extensive experiments over it. The evaluation results show that OneFi can recognize unseen gestures with the accuracy of 84.2, 94.2, 95.8, and 98.8\% when 1, 3, 5, 7 labeled samples are available, respectively, while the overall training process takes less than two minutes.},

abstract = {Deep learning greatly empowers Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors for various mobile sensing applications, including human activity recognition, human-computer interaction, localization and tracking, and many more. Most existing works require substantial amounts of well-curated labeled data to train IMU-based sensing models, which incurs high annotation and training costs. Compared with labeled data, unlabeled IMU data are abundant and easily accessible. In this work, we present LIMU-BERT, a novel representation learning model that can make use of unlabeled IMU data and extract generalized rather than task-specific features. LIMU-BERT adopts the principle of self-supervised training of the natural language model BERT to effectively capture temporal relations and feature distributions in IMU sensor measurements. However, the original BERT is not adaptive to mobile IMU data. By meticulously observing the characteristics of IMU sensors, we propose a series of techniques and accordingly adapt LIMU-BERT to IMU sensing tasks. The designed models are lightweight and easily deployable on mobile devices. With the representations learned via LIMU-BERT, task-specific models trained with limited labeled samples can achieve superior performances. We extensively evaluate LIMU-BERT with four open datasets. The results show that the LIMU-BERT enhanced models significantly outperform existing approaches in two typical IMU sensing applications.},

abstract = {Discovering patterns in time series data is essential to many key tasks in intelligent sensing systems, such as human activity recognition and event detection. These tasks involve the classification of sensory information from physical measurements such as inertial or temperature change measurements. Due to differences in the underlying physics, existing methods for classification use handcrafted features combined with traditional learning algorithms, or employ distinct deep neural models to directly learn from raw data.We propose here a unified neural architecture, UniTS, for sensory time series classification in various tasks, which obviates the need for domain-specific feature, model customization or polished hyper-parameter tuning. This is possible as we believe that discriminative patterns in sensory measurements would manifest when we combine information from both the time and frequency domains.In particular, to reveal the commonality of sensory signals, we integrate Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) into neural networks by initializing convolutional filter weights as the Fourier coefficients. Instead of treating STFT as a static linear transform with fixed coefficients, we make these weights optimizable during network training, which essentially learns to weigh each frequency channel. Recognizing that time-domain signals might represent intuitive physics such as temperature and acceleration, we combine linearly transformed time-domain hidden features with the frequency components within each time chunk. We further extend our model to multiple branches with different time-frequency resolutions to avoid the need of hyper-parameter search.We conducted experiments on four public datasets containing time-series data from various IoT systems, including motion, WiFi, EEG, and air quality, and compared UniTS with numerous recent models. Results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an average F1 score of 91.85\% with a 2.3-point improvement over the state of the art. We also verified the efficacy of STFT-inspired structures through numerous quantitative studies.},

abstract = {Recent innovations in energy harvesting promise extended operational life and reduced maintenance costs for the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. However, energy management in these platforms remains problematic due to dynamism in energy supply and demand, inefficiency in storing and converting energy and a lack of per-task charge isolation. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a software defined charge storage module called Morphy, which combines a polymorphic capacitor array with intelligent power management software. Morphy delivers energy to application tasks in a flexible, efficient, and isolated manner. Morphy provides two software extensions to the Operating System scheduler: the energy semaphore blocks the execution of tasks until sufficient charge is available to safely run them, and the energy watchdog monitors and mitigates energy management bugs. We have realized a prototype of Morphy with the hardware form factor of a standard 9V (PP3) battery package and a software library that integrates with the FreeRTOS scheduler. Our evaluation shows that, in comparison to standard energy storage and management approaches, our prototype reaches an operational voltage more quickly, sustains operation longer in the case of power failure and effectively isolates charge storage for dedicated tasks with minimal compute, memory and energy overhead.},

abstract = {We present ALFRED: a virtual memory abstraction that resolves the dichotomy between volatile and non-volatile memory in intermittent computing. Mixed-volatile microcontrollers allow programmers to allocate part of the application state onto non-volatile memory. Programmers are therefore to manually explore the tradeoff between simpler management of persistent state against energy overhead and possibility of intermittence anomalies due to nonvolatile memory operations. This approach is laborious and yields sub-optimal performance. We take a different stand with ALFRED: we provide programmers with a virtual memory abstraction detached from the specific volatile nature of memory and automatically determine an efficient mapping from virtual to volatile or non-volatile memory. Unlike existing works, ALFRED does not require programmers to learn a new language syntax and the mapping is entirely resolved at compile-time, reducing the run-time energy overhead. We implement ALFRED through a series of machine-level code transformations. Compared to existing systems, we demonstrate that ALFRED reduces energy consumption by up to two orders of magnitude given a fixed workload. This enables workloads to finish sooner, as the use of available energy shifts from ensuring forward progress to useful application processing.},

abstract = {Low-power wireless sensor networks have demonstrated their potential for the detection of rare events such as rockfalls and wildfires, where rapid reporting as well as long-term energy-efficient operation is vital. However, current systems require periodic synchronization to maintain network coordination, heavily rely on node placement or use costly long-range links to infrastructure. We present STeC, a novel wireless communication design that directly exploits the spatial and temporal correlation of signals from the sensed phenomenon to orchestrate event-based communication. We leverage the locality of a co-detection, where a physical event triggers multiple sensors quasi-simultaneously, to efficiently collect, characterize and report sensor data. This eliminates the overhead of periodic network activity and centralized control, resulting in more energy-efficient communication with a lower, more consistent detection latency. In doing so, we propose a fundamentally new approach to avoid the elementary conflict between duty cycle and latency requirements immanent to synchronous protocols by exploiting correlated sensor signals for networking. Experiments using real-world traces of a natural hazard detection application show that STeC reduces the detection latency by up to 87 \% compared to standard single-hop communication and outperforms traditional schedule-based methods by up to 58.4 x in energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Tiny hidden spy cameras concealed in sensitive locations including hotels and bathrooms are becoming a significant threat worldwide. These hidden cameras are easily purchasable and are extremely difficult to find with the naked eye due to their small form factor. The state-of-the-art solutions that aim to detect these cameras are limited as they require specialized equipment and yield low detection rates. Recent academic works propose to analyze the wireless traffic that hidden cameras generate. These proposals, however, are also limited because they assume wireless video streaming, while only being able to detect the presence of the hidden cameras, and not their locations. To overcome these limitations, we present LAPD, a novel hidden camera detection and localization system that leverages the time-of-flight (ToF) sensor on commodity smartphones. We implement LAPD as a smartphone app that emits laser signals from the ToF sensor, and use computer vision and machine learning techniques to locate the unique reflections from hidden cameras. We evaluate LAPD through comprehensive real-world experiments by recruiting 379 participants and observe that LAPD achieves an 88.9\% hidden camera detection rate, while using just the naked eye yields only a 46.0\% hidden camera detection rate.},

abstract = {Time-of-flight (ToF) depth cameras have been increasingly adopted in various real-world applications, e.g., used with RGB cameras for advanced computer vision tasks like 3-D mapping or deployed alone in privacy-sensitive applications such as sleep monitoring. In this paper, we propose UltraDepth, the first system that can expose high-resolution texture from depth maps captured by off-the-shelf ToF cameras, simply by introducing a distorting IR source. The exposed texture information can significantly augment depth-based applications. Moreover, such a capability can be used to launch privacy attacks, which poses a major concern due to the prominence of ToF cameras. To design UltraDepth, we present an in-depth analysis on the impact of the distorting IR light on the distance measurement. We further show that, the reflection properties (reflectivity and incidence angle) of the objects will be encoded in the distorted depth map and hence can be leveraged to reveal texture of objects in UltraDepth. We then propose two practical implementations of UltraDepth, i.e., reflection-based and external IR-based implementations. Our extensive real-world experiments show that, the depth maps output by UltraDepth achieve 89.06\%, 99.33\%, 81.25\% mean accuracy in object detection, face recognition and character recognition, respectively, which offers over 10x improvement over the ordinary depth maps and even approaches the performance of RGB and IR images in a number of scenarios. The findings of this work provide key insights for new research on depth-related computer vision and security of depth sensing devices.},

abstract = {We are now witnessing a trend of realizing full-screen on electronic devices such as smartphones to maximize their screen-to-body ratio for a better user experience. Thus the bezel/narrow-bezel on today's devices to host various line-of-sight sensors would disappear. This trend not only is forcing sensors like the front cameras to be placed under the screen of devices, but also will challenge the deployment of the emerging Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology, a paradigm for the next-generation wireless communication.In this work, we propose the concept of through-screen VLC with photosensors placed under Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) screen. Though being transparent, an OLED screen greatly attenuates the intensity of passing-through light, degrading the efficiency of intensity-based VLC systems. In this paper, we instead exploit the color domain to build SpiderWeb, a through-screen VLC system. For the first time, we observe that an OLED screen introduces a color-pulling effect at photosensors, affecting the decoding of color-based VLC signals. Motivated by this observation and by the structure of spider's web, we design the SWebCSK Color-Shift Keying modulation scheme and a slope-based demodulation method, which can eliminate the color-pulling effect. We prototype SpiderWeb with off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance thoroughly under various scenarios. The results show that compared to existing solutions, our solutions can reduce the bit error rate by two orders of magnitude and can achieve a 3.4x data rate.},

abstract = {Today, most autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) perception to acquire accurate information about their immediate surroundings. In LiDAR-based perception systems, semantic segmentation plays a critical role as it can divide LiDAR point clouds into meaningful regions according to human perception and provide AVs with semantic understanding of the driving environments. However, an implicit assumption for existing semantic segmentation models is that they are performed in a reliable and secure environment, which may not be true in practice. In this paper, we investigate adversarial attacks against LiDAR semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework based on which the attacker can easily fool LiDAR semantic segmentation by placing some simple objects (e.g., cardboard and road signs) at some locations in the physical space. We conduct extensive real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed attack framework. The experimental results show that our attack can achieve more than 90\% success rate in real-world driving environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on physically realizable adversarial attacks against LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation with real-world evaluations.},

abstract = {Range Of Motion (ROM) of joints is a key biomarker in assessing the osteokinematics of muskuloskeletal system. Goniometry of ROM is effected by orthopaedists through manual measurement using medical grade goniometers. Such measurement requires personal presence of a medical expert especially in passive goniometry. For a digital estimation of ROM of shoulder and elbow joints, smart wearables embedded with inertial sensors have been used. Although they cover a wide variety of ROM measurements, but fail for measurements made in certain planes, and require sensor specific calibration. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate a calibration-free solution for ROM estimation of shoulder and elbow joints, 'ROMeasure' which can work in any random plane of measurement with a high accuracy even at extremely slow speed of rotation greatly enhancing its practicality in a medical scenario. The demonstration includes a user wearing a smartwatch, and rotating elbow/shoulder joints. Graphs for real-time angle and rotation speed are displayed on a computer screen in real time and at the end of session, final range of motion is calculated. We believe that such a setup can be extrememly useful in a tele-health scenario, and owing to the pervasiveness of smart devices today, it can prove to be a highly convenient yet accurate solution for self-assessment. Our system has been observed to incur MAE of less than 5 degrees in meticulous experimentation performed on different subjects in multiple planes of rotation, even at a rotational speed of under 10 degrees per second.},

The rotation speed measurements can be used to enhance the machines' vibration signal analysis and can also elicit faults undetectable by vibration monitoring alone.

These sensors require line-of-sight and direct access to the machine which limits their use-cases. In this demo, we showcase Cognisense, an RF-based hardware-software sensing system that uses Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) waves to accurately measure a machine's rotation speed. Cognisense uses a novel compact patch antenna in a monostatic radar configuration capable of transmitting and receiving OAM waves in the 5GHz license-exempt band. The demo will show Cognisense working on machines with varied numbers of blades, sizes and materials. We will also present how Cognisense operates reliably in non-line-of-sight scenarios where traditional tachometers fail. We demonstrate how Cognisense works well in high-scattering scenarios and is not impacted by the material of rotor blades. Unlike optical tachometers that require one to face the machine head-on, Our demo will also show Cognisense performing reliably in the presence of a tilt angle between the system and the machine which is not possible with optical tachometers.},

Second, we propose DIA, a system that seamlessly connects to the home environment and automatically discovers and jointly utilizes smart sensors and actuators around the home to provide services that are otherwise not possible. We demonstrate three services that DIA enables.},

abstract = {Next-generation wireless experimentation benefits from new large-scale open-access software defined radio (SDR) platforms. Each SDR's transmissions must be measured and monitored to guarantee spectrum compliance. The measured spectrum is, however, corrupted by external co-channel signals. This demo presents the Bidirectional Incident/Transmit Signal Separator (BITSS), a system which estimates the linear system model, the SDR's transmit signal, and the signals from other sources incident to the antenna, all on the fly and without a signal prior or system information. We implement and run BITSS on POWDER and evaluate its performance. The demo shows that BITSS enables separation over a range of signal parameters with high accuracy and alerts users and the operator whenever a spectrum violation occurs.},

abstract = {The large-scale Bluetooth low energy (BLE) location-based services (LBS) are challenging due to the requirement of additional Bluetooth beacons, which inevitably incur tremendous hardware and maintenance cost. To alleviate this issue, this work presents WiBeacon which repurposes ubiquitously deployed WiFi access points into virtual beacons via cross-technology communication (CTC). WiBeacon only requires moderate software updates in APs, thus enabling fast deployment with zero additional hardware and also low maintenance cost via the remote Internet access.We implement it on COTS WiFi APs and evaluate it in various scenarios including a real-world commercial BLE LBS application as the pilot study. During this two-week pilot study, our WiBeacon provides reliable LBS, e.g., as robust as conventional BLE beacons, for 512 users with 150 types of smartphones.

abstract = {The tremendous increase of malicious applications in the android ecosystem has prompted researchers to explore deep learning based malware detection models. However, research in other domains suggests that deep learning models are adversarially vulnerable, and thus we aim to investigate the robustness of deep learning based malware detection models. We first developed two image-based E-CNN malware detection models based on android permission and intent. We then acted as an adversary and designed the ECO-FGSM evasion attack against the above models, which achieved more than 50\% fooling rate with limited perturbations. The evasion attack converts maximum malware samples into adversarial samples while minimizing the perturbations and maintaining the sample's syntactical, functional, and behavioral integrity. Later, we used adversarial retraining to counter the evasion attack and develop adversarially superior malware detection models, which should be an essential step before any real-world deployment.},

Compared with traditional physical training and video games-based training, VR training can not only provide a sense of realism and immersion similar to physical training but can also train at any time and place, saving time and money. However, due to some constraints like lacking reflections of the ambient environment, the realism and immersion of VR training are insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose enhanced VR training which senses the ambient environment and reflects them as dynamic unexpected training tasks to solve the above problems.},

abstract = {Human respiration monitoring acts as a crucial role to indicate people's daily health. Compared with traditional respiration monitoring methods, device-free wireless respiration sensing technology is emerging as a promising modality due to the less privacy intrusive and without on-body sensors. However, due to the intrinsic nature of relying on weak reflection signals for sensing, the sensing range is limited. Meanwhile, reliable sensing performance only can be achieved when the environment with little or even no interference. In this work, we propose a WiFi-based respiration system to simultaneously enlarge the sensing range and mitigate the interference. The basic idea is to employ a reconfigurable metasurface to dynamically manipulate electromagnetic waves in the environment to achieve beamforming and beam steering. Our system thus enhances the sensing range and reduces the energy of reflected signals from interferers to ensure reliable performance. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.},

However, in multi-hop networks, it is up to the network protocol to ensure that all devices comply with such DC restrictions. We therefore developed a distributed DC adherence algorithm that limits the DC of all devices without introducing any additional packet overhead. This paper presents a brief description of the algorithm and evaluates its performance through simulation. Our results show that the algorithm can limit the DC of all devices to ensure no devices must switch off. Our algorithm therefore provides a solution for WSNs where nodes must operate below a DC limit.},

In this scenario, gradient quantization is an effective way to reduce bits count when transmitting each model update, but with a trade-off of having an elevated error floor due to higher variance of the stochastic gradients. In this paper, we propose ElastiCL, an elastic quantization strategy that achieves transmission efficiency plus a low error floor by dynamically altering the number of quantization levels during training on distributed IoT devices. Experiments on training ResNet-18, Vanilla CNN shows that ElastiCL can converge in much fewer transmitted bits than fixed quantization level, with little or no compromise on training and test accuracy.},

Commercially available "hidden camera detectors" have high false positive rates, and existing academic works detect (but cannot localize) only a subset of hidden cameras with wireless capabilities. We overcome these limitations by proposing LAPD, a novel hidden camera detection and localization system that leverages time-of-flight (ToF) sensors on commodity smartphones. LAPD is a smartphone app that detects hidden cameras in real-time by transmitting laser signals from the ToF sensor and searching for unique signatures representing reflections from hidden camera lenses. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, LAPD achieves significantly higher hidden camera detection rates compared to the naked eye and hidden camera detectors.},

abstract = {This research aimed to develop a high accuracy machine learning algorithm that can diagnose cardiovascular diseases from the stream of data from multiple body surface potential mapping devices equipped with 102 textile electrodes. The algorithm is based on the 1D convolutional neural network, trained on the comparable real-life data gathered from the FLUKE ECG simulator connected to the resistance-based human phantom. The developed neural network achieved an accuracy of 99.91\% on the test data. Additionally, an additional algorithm was developed that can use the neural network to analyse the data streamed from the medical device and notice the medical staff about dangerous heart rhythms detected by the system.},

abstract = {Compared to RGB camera and Lidar, single chip automotive radar is a promising alternative sensor with robustness to adverse weathers. But the sparseness of radar output drastically hinders its usefulness for autonomous driving tasks. Up-sampling via image style transfer could be a cure for a sparse measurement. However, it remains unknown whether style transfer can be an effective solution to automotive radar which features different and unique sparse and noisy issues. In this paper, we evaluate a variety of predominant image style transfer methods for a typical ego-vehicle pose estimation task on the public nuScenes dataset, and find that though image style transfer methods can improve the visual quality of automotive radar measurements, they can hardly contribute to the utility of radar for downstream tasks.},

abstract = {Edge computing for the Internet of Things prescribes executing applications on server machines closer to devices rather than depending on the cloud. However, server machines are expensive, are not flexible to adapt to varying application requirements, require gateways to interact with IoT devices, and follow a centralized model which increases traffic and application latency. Special-purpose hardware for the edge is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with support for machine learning, secure enclaves etc., and this work is an attempt to leverage such hardware to cooperatively execute edge applications, rather than relying on expensive edge servers. To do so, our design relies on a distributed middleware which can seamlessly scale up with new hardware, and a task scheduler which best matches application requirements with the hardware capabilities available. We have built a prototype middleware that operates on multiple gateways in our testbed of 250 IoT devices, and we plan to further improve our platform to support more varying use cases.},

Existing systems focus on vision- and wearable-based sensing approaches, which require direct line-of-sight or device-carrying and may also raise privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new monitoring system for social distancing compliance based on footstep-induced floor vibration sensing. This system is device-free, non-intrusive, and perceived as more privacy-friendly. Our system leverages the insight that footsteps closer to the sensors generate vibration signals with larger amplitudes. The system first estimates the location of each person relative to the sensors based on signal energy and then infers the distance between two people. We evaluated the system through a real-world experiment with 8 people, and the system achieves an average accuracy of 97.8\% for walking scenario classification and 80.4\% in social distancing violation detection.},

Setting the size of the TSCH slotframe has a considerable effect on the performance of scheduling algorithms used in IoT networks. Although IETF and IEEE standards define general mechanisms for communication of TSCH nodes, finding the optimal size of the TSCH slotframe has been left open and unresolved. In this poster, we propose an algorithm called S-TSCH to find the optimal size of the TSCH slotframe for maximizing network throughput based on 1) the number of nodes placed in the topology, 2) the data generation rate of applications running on IoT nodes, 3) and the maximum rate of generating TSCH/RPL control packets. To evaluate the performance of our contribution, we implement S-TSCH on Zolerita Firefly IoT motes and the Contiki-NG operating system. Evaluation results show that our proposed method improves the performance of distributed TSCH scheduling algorithms in terms of reliability and delay.},

Despite recent advances in this area, there are several practical requirements that are often overlooked. Specifically, fusion networks must maintain their performance during momentary and long-term changes in the environment, be robust to sensor data quality issues, and have a reasonable size so that they can be deployed on resource-constrained devices. My PhD research aims to address these challenges by building robust multimodal fusion networks that rapidly generalize to new environments and have a smaller number of trainable weights, hence lower memory and carbon footprints.},

Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the performance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate scheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and FedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The system efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.

abstract = {Ontology matching enables harmonizing heterogeneous data models. Existing ontology matching approaches include machine learning. In particular, recent works leverage weak supervision (WS) through programmatic labeling to avoid the intensive hand-labeling for large ontologies. Programmatic labeling relies on heuristics and rules, called Labeling Functions (LFs), that generate noisy and incomplete labels. However, to cover a reasonable portion of the dataset, programmatic labeling might require a significant number of LFs that might be time expensive and not always straightforward to program.This paper proposes a novel system, namely OntoAugment, that augments LF labels for the ontology matching problem, starting from outcomes of the LFs. Our solution leverages the "similarity of similarities" between ontology concept bipairs that are two pairs of concepts. OntoAugment projects a label yielded by an LF for a concept pair to a similar pair that the same LF does not label. Thus, a wider portion of the dataset is covered even with a limited set of LFs. Experimentation results show that OntoAugment provides significant improvements (up to 11 F1 points) compared to the state-of-the-art WS approach when fewer LFs are used, whereas it maintains the performance without creating additional noise when a higher number of LFs already achieves high performance.},

In this paper, we propose a new sensor data processing framework, which leverages a co-dependency between data quality and model robustness to detect performance issues of data-driven predictive models in the field. We show how distribution shifts in the input data impact the quality of the model, which relies on application-specific sensors, and present indicators capable of detecting such shifts in the wild.

abstract = {When deploying machine learning (ML) models on embedded and IoT devices, performance encompasses more than an accuracy metric: inference latency, energy consumption, and model fairness are necessary to ensure reliable performance under heterogeneous and resource-constrained operating conditions. To this end, prior research has studied model-centric approaches, such as tuning the hyperparameters of the model during training and later applying model compression techniques to tailor the model to the resource needs of an embedded device. In this paper, we take a data-centric view of embedded ML and study the role that pre-processing parameters in the data pipeline can play in balancing the various performance metrics of an embedded ML system. Through an in-depth case study with audio-based keyword spotting (KWS) models, we show that pre-processing parameter tuning is a remarkable tool that model developers can adopt to trade-off between a model's accuracy, fairness, and system efficiency, as well as to make an embedded ML model resilient to unseen deployment conditions.},

In this paper, we introduce a new problem setting in this multi-device context called Federated Learning in Multi-Device Local Networks (FL-MDLN). We identify core challenges for FL-MDLN in relation to its federation architecture, and statistical and systems heterogeneity across multiple users and multiple devices. Then, we introduce a new user-as-client (UAC) federation architecture, and propose various device selection strategies to counter statistical and systems heterogeneity in FL-MDLN.

abstract = {The fast-growing trend of Internet of Things (IoT) has provided its users with opportunities to improve user experience such as voice assistants, smart cameras, and home energy management systems. Such smart home applications often require large numbers of diverse training data to accomplish a robust model. As single user may not have enough data to train such a model, users intent to collaboratively train their collected data in order to achieve better performance in such applications, which raise the concern of data privacy protection. Existing approaches for collaborative training need to aggregate data or intermediate model training updates in the cloud to perform load forecasting, which could directly or indirectly cause personal data leakage, alongside with significant communication bandwidth and extra cloud service monetary cost.In this paper, to ensure the performance of smart home applications as well as the protection of user data privacy, we introduce the decentralized federated learning framework for the neighborhood and show the study on residential building load forecasting application as an example. We present PriResi, a privacy-preserved, communication-efficient and cloud-service-free load forecasting system to solve the above problems in a residential building. We first introduce a decentralized federated learning framework, which allows the residents to process all collected data locally on the edge by broadcasting the model updates between the smart home agent in each residence. Second, we propose a gradient selection mechanism to reduce the number of aggregated gradients and the frequency of gradient broadcasting to achieve communication-efficient and high prediction results. The real-word dataset experiments show that our method can achieve 97\% of load forecasting accuracy while preserving residences' privacy. We believe that our proposed decentralized federated learning framework can be widely used in other smart home applications as well.},

abstract = {Users are surrounded by sensors that are available through various devices beyond their smartphones. However, these sensors are not fully utilized by current end-user applications. A key reason sensor use is so limited is that application developers must exactly identify how the sensor data can be used by smartphone apps. To mitigate this problem, we present SenseWear, a sensor-sharing platform that extends the functionality of a smartphone to use remote sensors with limited additional developer effort. Sensor sharing has several uses, including augmenting the hardware in smartphones, creating new gestural interactions with smartphone applications, and improving application's Quality of Experience via higher-quality sensors from other devices, such as wearables. We developed and present six use cases that use remote sensors in various smartphone applications. Each extension requires adding fewer than 20 lines of code on average. Furthermore, using remote sensors did not introduce a perceptible increase in latency, and creates more convenient interaction options for smartphone apps.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed sensors becoming an indispensable part of our life with the camera being one of the most popular and widely deployed sensors. The camera gives rise to numerous vision-based IoT applications that generate high-level understandings of a live video stream by performing analysis on end devices like mobile or embedded devices. Typically, these applications are built with deep learning (DL) models to conduct complex vision tasks, e.g., image classification and object detection. Due to the prohibitive cost of running DL models on end devices close to the camera and with limited computation capabilities, it is widely adopted to offload the computation to a nearby powerful edge server. However, there is a gap between the restricted offloading bandwidth of the end device and the large volume of image data incurred by the live video stream. In this paper, we present Deep Contextualized Compressive Offloading for Images (DCCOI), a lightweight, context-aware, and bandwidth-efficient offloading framework for images. DCCOI consists of the spatial-adaptive encoder, a lightweight neural network, to spatial-adaptively compress the image, and the generative decoder for reconstructing the image from the compressed data. In contrast to existing DL-based encoders, the spatial-adaptive encoder allows an image region to be encoded into different numbers of feature values based on the information in it. This offers a variable-length coding method for image compression, which is a more optimal way for compression than the fix-length coding method took by existing DL-based compression approaches and demonstrates superior accuracy-compression rate trade-offs. We evaluate DCCOI against several baseline compression techniques while serving an object detection-based application. The results show that DCCOI roughly reduces the offloading size of JPEG by a factor of 9 and DeepCOD, the state-of-the-art offloading approach, by 20\% with similar accuracy and a compression overhead less than 50ms.},

abstract = {Video cameras are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), live video analytics are enabling various useful services, including traffic monitoring and campus surveillance. However, current video analytics systems are highly limited in leveraging the enormous opportunities of the deployed cameras due to (i) centralized processing architecture (i.e., cameras are treated as dumb streaming-only sensors), (ii) hard-coded analytics capabilities from tightly coupled hardware and software, (iii) isolated and fragmented camera deployment from different service providers, and (iv) independent processing of camera streams without any collaboration. In this paper, we envision a full-fledged system for software-defined video analytics with cross-camera collaboration that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. We illustrate its detailed system architecture, carefully analyze the key system requirements with representative app scenarios, and derive potential research issues along with a summary of the status quo of existing works.},

abstract = {Motivated by the trend of realizing full screens on devices such as smartphones, in this work we propose through-screen sensing with visible light for the application of fingertip air-writing. The system can recognize handwritten digits with under-screen photodiodes as the receiver. The key idea is to recognize the weak light reflected by the finger when the finger writes the digits on top of a screen. The proposed air-writing system has immunity to scene changes because it has a fixed screen light source. However, the screen is a double-edged sword as both a signal source and a noise source. We propose a data preprocessing method to reduce the interference of the screen as a noise source. We design an embedded deep learning model, a customized model ConvRNN, to model the spatial and temporal patterns in the dynamic and weak reflected signal for air-writing digits recognition. The evaluation results show that our through-screen fingertip air-writing system with visible light can achieve accuracy up to 91\%. Results further show that the size of the customized ConvRNN model can be reduced by 94\% with less than a 10\% drop in performance.},

abstract = {With the increasing adaption of solar energy worldwide, there is a huge interest to develop systems that help drive efficiency during manufacturing and ongoing operations. Due to various real-world conditions and processes, solar panels develop faults during their manufacturing and operations. The objective of this work is to build an End-to-End Fault Detection system to detect and localize faults in solar panels based on their Electroluminescence (EL) Imaging. Today, the majority of fault detection happens through manual inspection of EL images. To this end, we propose the design and implementation of an end-to-end system that firstly divides the solar panel into individual solar cells and then passes these cell images through a classification + detection pipeline for identifying the fault type and localizing the faults inside a cell. We propose a hybrid architecture that contains an ensemble of multiple CNN model architectures for classification and detection. The ensemble is capable of serving both - monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels. The proposed system significantly helps in increasing the efficiency of solar panels and reducing warranty and repair costs. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system using an open EL image dataset with 95\% of cell-level fault prediction accuracy and high recall. The proposed algorithms are applicable and can be extended for other solar applications that use RGB, EL, or thermal imaging techniques.},

The convergence of a large number of nodes at the IoT edge along with multiple service providers and network operators exposes data owners and resource providers to potential threats. To address cloud-edge risks, trust-based decentralized management is needed. Blockchain technology has created an opportunity to decentralize IoT ecosystems, through its intrinsic properties and together with machine learning (ML) it can be used to provide a trusted backbone for managing IoT ecosystems to support automated and adaptive trust management. This paper presents a novel approach for crosslayer intelligent trust computation modelling leveraging ML and Blockchain for decentralized trust management in IoT ecosystems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for flow-based trust assessment is demonstrated using the Hyperledger Framework and the Cooja-based simulation environment. Finally, an initial evaluation is presented to understand the performance in terms of scalability and trust convergence of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT) deployment in modern smart cities has enabled secure infrastructures with minimal human intervention. However, attacks on audio-video inputs affect the reliability of large-scale multimedia surveillance systems as attackers are able to manipulate the perception of live events. For example, Deepfake audio/video attacks and frame duplication attacks can cause significant security breaches. This paper proposes a Lightweight Environmental Fingerprint Consensus based detection of compromised smart cameras in edge surveillance systems (LEFC). LEFC is a partial decentralized authentication mechanism that leverages Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) as an environmental fingerprint and distributed ledger technology (DLT). An ENF signal carries randomly fluctuating spatio-temporal signatures, which enable digital media authentication. With the proposed DLT consensus mechanism named Proof-of-ENF (PoENF) as a backbone, LEFC can estimate and authenticate the media recording and detect byzantine nodes controlled by the perpetrator. The experimental evaluation shows feasibility and effectiveness of proposed LEFC scheme under a distributed byzantine network environment.},

However, the current insurance system is very expensive and the claim settlement process is excessively lengthy, making it tedious. This results in policyholders not being able to successfully make a claim with their insurance company. In this paper, we focus on developing a fast and cost-effective framework based on blockchain technology and machine learning for the health insurance industry. Blockchain is capable of removing all third-party organisations by forming a smart contract, making the entire process more smooth, secure, and efficient. The contract settles the claim on documents submitted by the claimant. A ridge regression model is used for computing the premiums optimally, based on the total amount claimed under the current policy tenure, along with several other factors. A random forest classifier is applied for predicting the risk that helps in the computation of risk-rated premium rebate.},

We present our easy-to-use thermal energy measurement platform built from off-the-shelf component modules and a custom TEG interface circuit.

Two devices exchanged IEEE 802.15.4 radio frames in a ping-pong manner on the phantom's fat tissue using Krentz's MAC layer. The data collected from this experiment lends itself to two purposes. First, it can serve to benchmark and tune algorithms for selecting radio channels. Second, it can also serve to benchmark and tune schemes for deriving cryptographic keys from received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings.

Recently, several multi-modal person Re-ID datasets were released, including RGB+IR, RGB+text, RGB+WiFi, which shows the potential of the multi-modal sensor-based person Re-ID approach. However, there are several common issues in public datasets, such as short time duration, lack of appearance change, and limited activities, resulting in un-robust models. For example, vision-based Re-ID models are sensitive to appearance change. In this work, a person Re-ID testbed with multi-modal sensors is created, allowing the collection of sensing modalities including RGB, IR, depth, WiFi, radar, and audio. This novel dataset will cover normal daily office activities with large time span over multi-seasons. Initial analytic results are obtained for evaluating different person Re-ID models, based on small datasets collected in this testbed.},

We developed two malicious scenarios, a denial of service and a privilege escalation attack, where an adversary uses a container to compromise the edge device. Furthermore, we deployed benign user containers to run in parallel with the malicious containers. Container activity can be captured through the host system via system calls. Our time series auditd dataset contains partial labels for the benign and malicious related system calls. Generating the dataset is largely automated using a provided AutoCES framework. We also present a semi-supervised machine learning use case with the collected data to demonstrate its utility. The dataset and framework code are open-source and publicly available.},

However, while research efforts abound, there is a very limited number of datasets that researchers can use to both understand how people use IoT devices and to evaluate algorithms or systems for smart spaces. In this paper, we collect and characterize more than 50,000 recipes from the online If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) service to understand a seemingly straightforward but complicated question: "What kinds of behaviors do humans expect from their IoT devices?" The dataset we collected contains the basic information of the IFTTT rules, trigger and action events, and how many people are using each rule.},

abstract = {Footstep-induced floor vibration sensing has been used in many smart home applications, such as elderly/patient monitoring. These systems often leverage data-driven models to infer human information. Therefore, characterizing datasets is crucial for the generalization of this new modality. This dataset contains 144-minute floor vibration signals from two pedestrians in eight environments. We analyze the reusability of this dataset in three different research areas, including vibration-based information inference, knowledge transferring, and multimodal learning. We further characterize the dataset transferability on the occupant identification task, to provide quantitative insights for the transfer learning problems in the real-world floor vibration sensing applications. The characterization is conducted with three metrics, including distribution distance, information dependency, and influencing factor bias. Analysis results depict that the dataset covers different levels of transferability caused by multiple influencing factors. As a result, there are multiple future directions in which the dataset can be reused.},

The dataset consists of 1770 thermal images with high-quality annotation collected from an indoor room with around 15°C. We implemented a privacy-preserving human detection method and trained a multiple object detection (MOD) model based on the dataset. The human detection method reaches 90.3\% accuracy. On the other hand, the MOD model achieved 56.8\% mean average precision (mAP).

abstract = {Thermal comfort affects the well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction of building occupants. However, due to economical and practical limitations, the number of longitudinal studies that have been conducted is limited, and only a few of these studies have shared their data publicly. Longitudinal datasets collected indoors are a valuable resource to better understand how people perceive their environment. Moreover, they provide a more realistic scenario to those conducted in thermal chambers. Our objective was to share publicly a longitudinal dataset comprising data collected over a 4-week long experiment. A total of 17 participants completed thermal preferences surveys which accounted for a total of approximately 1400 unique responses across indoor and outdoor 17 spaces. For the whole duration of the study, we monitored environmental variables (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) throughout 3 buildings. Participants completed comfort surveys from the screen of their smartwatches using an open-source application named Cozie. Their indoor location was continuously monitored using a custom-designed smartphone application. Location data were used to time and spatially align environmental measurements to thermal preference responses provided by the participants. Background information of participants, such as physical characteristics and personality traits (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits), was collected using an on-boarding survey administered at the beginning of the experiment. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/5502441#.YT7xyaARUTs.},

In particular, as evidenced by the famous Mirai incident and other ongoing threats, large-scale IoT device networks are particularly susceptible to being hijacked and used as botnets to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Real large-scale datasets are needed to train and evaluate the use of machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks to detect and defend against such DDoS attacks. We present a dataset from an urban IoT deployment of 4060 nodes describing their spatio-temporal activity under benign conditions. We also provide a synthetic DDoS attack generator that injects attack activity into the dataset based on tunable parameters such as number of nodes attacked and duration of attack. We discuss some of the features of the dataset. We also demonstrate the utility of the dataset as well as our synthetic DDoS attack generator by using them for the training and evaluation of a simple multi-label feed-forward neural network that aims to identify which nodes are under attack and when.},

abstract = {Recently, several datasets shedding light on connectivity aspects in real-world LoRa networks have been provided to the community. However, they typically only involve a limited number of nodes, deal with unidirectional communication only, or focus on very specific physical layer settings. More importantly, existing datasets typically lack fine-grained environmental information such as the temperature in the surroundings of each node, which is known to have a strong impact on communication performance. In this work, we provide the community with a comprehensive dataset that fills all these gaps. We have collected detailed connectivity information in an outdoor LoRa network composed of 21 nodes for more than four months. Our dataset does not only focus on network-level performance (e.g., the average number of correctly-exchanged packets), but sheds light on link-level information such as the received signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of available neighbours over time. We further collect environmental information from an online weather site, as well as the on-board temperature of each node in the network, which varies considerably across the deployed locations. We collect all this information while perpetually changing physical layer settings such as the spreading factor and the RF channel. A preliminary analysis of our dataset, which is available in Zenodo1, reveals that temperature has a significant correlation with the link quality and connectivity in the outdoor LoRa network, confirming the findings of earlier studies.},

Therefore, SQUID can predict the charging time of the batteryless sensors by using the predicted power availability. Our initial experiments showed that SQUID has a promising estimation accuracy by consuming up to 10 times less energy than existing timekeeping solutions.},

These energy harvesting systems have an energy management subsystem to orchestrate the flow of energy and optimize their achievable system performance. Numerous such algorithms for a single harvesting-based system have been proposed. When envisioning the joint use of multiple distributed energy harvesting nodes in a single application, the performance and behavior of the distributed system depends on the mutual energy availability and therefore energy management of all nodes. We propose to perform the energy management of multiple distributed energy harvesting nodes jointly and thus, optimize the distributed system's performance as opposed to the performance of each energy harvesting node individually. We demonstrate the novel joint optimization in a scenario with multiple energy harvesting nodes and observe that the distributed system's performance improves by 28 \% compared to when each node's energy is managed individually.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices have enveloped our surroundings and have been increasingly deployed in many domains. Even though the IoT has generated unprecedented opportunities, the poorly secured design of IoT devices makes them an easy target for cyber attacks. Aimed at securing IoT devices, Remote Attestation (RA) is a security technique that identifies threat presence in IoT systems. Typically, RA is an atomic procedure that requires uninterrupted connectivity to execute. However, in energy harvesting context where intermittent IoT devices go into sleep mode immediately after regular operations, the atomic property is difficult to achieve. In this paper, we propose RESERVE, a novel lightweight RA protocol designed specifically for Intermittent IoT devices. RESERVE aims to improve the security of intermittent systems by detecting malware presence during online mode and guaranteeing with some probability software legitimacy during offline mode. In particular, RESERVE ensures trustworthiness by organizing the device's software into modules, and after regular operation each device attests as many modules as fit in its energy budget.},

abstract = {Battery-less energy-harvesting systems have widened the landscape of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications by taking computation to hard-to-reach places. Energy-harvesting sensors are perpetual, environment-friendly, cost-effective, and maintenance-free. Despite having such lucrative characteristics, battery-powered devices hold majority share of today's IoT market, since developing energy-harvesting applications require more expert knowledge, careful implementation, and rigorous debugging than applications with stable power. In this paper, we argue that development becomes easier, faster, efficient, and scalable with a standard, re-usable, general purpose platform that ensures the platform's versatility across various application with proper balance between abstraction and accessibility in hardware and software. Such platforms would provide flexibility across both hardware and software layers, at the same time, producing reliable performance. However, realizing this design point pose several research challenges that need to be identified and addressed. We identify the limitations in existing systems, articulate the challenges and provide guidelines for the community to work towards a general purpose platform that would enable new diversified battery-less applications in the future.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is emerging as an Internet of Things (IoT) technology that effectively connects small devices and sensors. It can enable many smart building use cases such as automation and control, environmental condition monitoring, and indoor location services. The BLE mesh standard provides a friendship feature to support Low Power Nodes (LPNs). We demonstrate how these BLE LPNs can support communication (uplink, downlink, or bidirectional) when powered by ambient indoor light using a mini solar panel and a small capacitor for energy storage. Being batteryless, it can exhibit intermittent behaviour with periodic ON and OFF states. However, with the knowledge of the capacitor voltage, an energy-aware LPN can try to avoid the OFF state. It can delay the execution of upcoming tasks by switching to an SLEEP state (consuming minimum energy) and provide some time to recharge the capacitor. We consider an example use case of monitoring temperature and room occupancy. The mesh nodes in the network can send instructions (such as turn-on an LED or a buzzer) to the batteryless LPN that should be executed by it. We study the use-case with real experiments on the communication feasibility of an energy-aware BLE LPN in a network and characterize the capacitance behaviour by placing a 6 W light bulb at 120 cm from the solar panel.},

In near-optimal, super moist conditions our cell provides approximately 100 μW of power at around 500 mV, which is ample power over time to power our system several times a day. In sum, we find that the confluence of ever lower-power electronics and new understanding of microbial fuel cell design means that "soil-powered sensors" are now feasible.

abstract = {Early detection of diseases in the human body is of utmost importance for the diagnosis and medical treatment of patients. Supported by recent advancements in nanotechnology, diseases may be detected by patrolling nanosensors, even before symptoms appear. This paper explores the detection capabilities of nanosensors flowing through the human circulatory system (HCS). We model the HCS through a Markov chain and propose the use of machine learning (ML) methods to learn the corresponding transition probabilities. Doing so, we propose a methodology to develop an early detection mechanism of quorum sensing (QS) molecules released by bacteria. Simulation results indicate the suitability of our machine learning approach as a basis for in-body precision medicine.},

abstract = {It has been established that interfacing Terahertz (THz) band signals with protein molecules excites their resonant modes. In this work, we develop a model that bridges the mechanical system of proteins, modeled as harmonic oscillators, and the probability of protein conformal changes. We deploy the Langevin stochastic equation under the influence of an external force to capture the protein dynamics. The average energy driving the protein to alter its conformation is derived and used to determine the probability of protein folding. Our numerical analysis results show that the energy transferred from the nanoantenna and stored in the protein is capable of inducing a conformal change in the protein. This illustrates the power of THz waves in enabling protein interactions with high selectivity. It also sheds light on various opportunities that impact applications concerning targeted therapy, biosensing as well as disease control and prevention.},

abstract = {Communication cost in terms of energy consumption and network latency, along with the dynamic allocation time of the tasks and their execution time, is the primary design concern of a run-time mapping and scheduling strategy that may significantly affect the overall performance of an application. The present work proposes a dynamic mapping and scheduling algorithm based on the Cube-Tree-Hybrid (CTH) topology. The CTH network can integrate a large number of IP cores under significantly low network diameter, as opposed to mesh. Moreover, the design of CTH comes with considerable path diversity. For the above properties, mapping on CTH becomes simpler than mesh, which successfully minimizes the communication hop distance amongst various tasks of an application. Extensive experimentation has been done across several synthetic and real application workloads. Compared to the prevalent mesh-based mapping techniques, the proposed algorithm achieves a minimum gain of 56\% on communication latency, whereas it is 36\% in total power consumption. Minimum 14\% improvement on applications' deadline satisfaction is achieved.},

abstract = {The primary role of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is to restore the propagation path between the access point (AP) and the user equipment (UE) in a non-line-of-sight communication link. Depending on the RIS placement with respect to the AP and UE positions, different power levels can reach the UE, thus affecting the quality of the communication. Particularly when the UE moves freely, the RIS position that maximizes the received signal will depend strongly on the UE location. In this context, we use an analytical model to assess the decisions that have to be made concerning the positioning of the RIS, which are determined by the interplay of three crucial quantities, namely (a) the available AP gain, (b) the available positions for the AP and RIS placement, and (c) the minimum desired power levels at the UE. The impact of the AP antenna gain tunability on the RIS placement selection is assessed and illustrated in D-band indoor scenarios.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the clock speed, and hence, the singlecore performance of microprocessors has already stagnated. Following this, the recent faltering of Moore's law due to the CMOS fabrication technology reaching its unavoidable physical limit has presaged daunting challenges for designing power-efficient and ultrafast microprocessors. To overcome these challenges, vigorous efforts have been made to develop new more-than-Moore technologies and architectures for computing. Among these, nanophotonic integrated circuits based computing architectures have shown revolutionary potential. Among recent demonstrations of nanophotonic circuits for computing, a polymorphic, nanophotonic ALU (PoN-ALU) carries a notable importance since it has shown very high flexibility, high speed, and low power consumption for computing. In this paper, we carry out a design space exploration of this PoN-ALU to derive new design guidelines that can help scale the speed and energy efficiency of PoNALU even further.},

abstract = {We envision swarms of mm-scale micro-robots to be able to carry out critical missions such as exploration and mapping for hazard detection and search and rescue. These missions share the need to reach full coverage of the explorable space and build a complete map of the environment. To minimize completion time, robots in the swarm must be able to exchange information about the environment with each other. However, communication between swarm members is often assumed to be perfect, an assumption that does not reflect real-world conditions, where impairments can affect the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of the wireless links. This paper studies how communication impairments can have a drastic impact on the performance of a robotic swarm. We present Atlas 2.0, an exploration algorithm that natively takes packet loss into account. We simulate the effect of various PDRs on robotic swarm exploration and mapping in three different scenarios. Our results show that the time it takes to complete the mapping mission increases significantly as the PDR decreases: on average, halving the PDR triples the time it takes to complete mapping. We emphasise the importance of considering methods to compensate for the delay caused by lossy communication when designing and implementing algorithms for robotics swarm coordination.},

In this work-in-progress report, we apply this idea to a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) context. Specifically, we demonstrate that using an on-chip RIS we can simultaneously shape multiple channel impulse responses (CIRs) such that they become essentially pulse-like despite rich scattering inside the chip enclosure. Pulse-like CIRs are essential to enable high-speed information exchange between different processors on the same chip with the simple on-off-keying modulation schemes envisaged for WNoCs.},

abstract = {Novel non-invasive procedures, such as targeted drug delivery may enhance the efficacy of treatments of cardiac disorders. A possible solution is to utilize a molecular communication paradigm based on cell-derived nano-sized vesicles --- extracellular vesicles (EVs) --- that can be used as vehicles for therapeutic biological cargo. EVs can be engineered with specific cell-targeting transmembrane proteins to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we study the transport of EVs in a non-cellular component of cardiac tissue referred to as the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). We inspect EV diffusion and advection in cardiac ECM by considering 1) tortuosity, which describes the convoluted pathway of EV transportation, 2) volume fraction, which characterizes the porosity of the cardiac ECM; and 3) EV degradation according to their half-life in the body. We analytically describe the EV transportation dynamics via a partial differential equation and solve it numerically using finite element methods. The presented findings indicate that EV propagation is dependent on the cardiac ECM hindrance sources. Bulk flow in the cardiac ECM, however, can mediate the EVs to reach their distant target cells.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of retroactivity describes the impact that a downstream system has on an upstream one when they are connected. From a molecular communication point of view, the effect of the signal that is back propagated between the two systems leads to a reduction of the correct amount of information that can be exchanged between the input and the output of the upstream system. In this work we propose a solution to mitigate such a negative effect. Specifically, a retroactivity suppressor is introduced, which role is that of binding to the downstream system in place of the output of the primary upstream system.},

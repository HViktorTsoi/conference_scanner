abstract = {We characterize the accuracy of a wildlife localization system that is based on the reverse-GPS or time-of-arrival (TOA) principle, in which radio receivers at known locations collaborate to determine the location of a transmitter attached to a wild animal. We describe the system and its real-world deployment in detail and show that it produces accurate location estimates in real settings and over long periods of time. Localization errors of wild animals carrying our transmitters (when stationary in nest boxes) have standard deviation of about 5m and mean of 5-15m (but sometimes as high as 24m). The mean error changes slowly with a time constant of hours or more and is frequency dependent; in the center of the receiver's band-pass filters, the mean error is usually about 5m. These characterizations are of raw localizations, without path-based filtering and smoothing. We also show how to reliably quantify the error in each individual location estimate. In addition to the characterization of accuracy, we introduce three technical innovations in the system. First, a method to model the error of individual time-of-arrival measurements, enabling correct weighing of the data to estimate locations and allowing estimation of the covariance matrix of each location estimate. Second, extensive use of known-position beacon transmitters, to synchronize the clocks of receivers (radio-frequency TOA localization require accurate clocks), to characterize and continuously monitor the performance of the system, and to model arrival-time-estimation errors. Third, we estimate the covariance matrix of each localization.},

abstract = {Face recognition is one of the most popular research problems on various platforms. New research issues arise when it comes to resource constrained devices, such as smart glasses, due to the overwhelming computation and energy requirements of the accurate face recognition methods. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient sensor-assisted face recognition system on smart glasses by exploring the power of multimodal sensors including the camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The system is based on a novel face recognition algorithm, namely Multi-view Sparse Representation Classification (MVSRC), by exploiting the prolific information among multi-view face images. To improve the efficiency of MVSRC on smart glasses, we propose a novel sampling optimization strategy using the less expensive inertial sensors. Our evaluations on public and private datasets show that the proposed method is up to 10\% more accurate than the state-of-the-art multi-view face recognition methods while its computation cost is in the same order as an efficient benchmark method (e.g., Eigenfaces). Finally, extensive real-world experiments show that our proposed system improves recognition accuracy by up to 15\% while achieving the same level of system overhead compared to the existing face recognition system (OpenCV algorithms) on smart glasses.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of wearable and implantable devices has sparked a new set of mobile computing applications that leverage the abundant information from sensors. For many of these applications, ensuring the security of communication between legitimate devices is a crucial problem. In this paper, we design Walkie-Talkie, a shared secret key generation scheme that allows two legitimate devices to establish a common cryptographic key by exploiting users' walking characteristics (gait). The intuition is that the sensors on different locations on the same body experience similar accelerometer signals when the user is walking. However, the accelerometer also captures motion signals produced by other body parts (e.g., swinging arms). It is shown that a Blind Source Separation (BSS) technique can extract the informative signal produced by the unique gait patterns. Our experimental results show that the keys generated by two independent devices on the same body are able to achieve up to a 100\% bit agreement rate. To demonstrate the feasibility, the proposed key generation scheme is implemented on modern smartphones. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can run in real-time on modern mobile devices and incurs low system overhead.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {There has been a growing interest in equipping the objects and environment surrounding users with sensing capabilities. Smart indoor spaces such as smart homes and offices can implement the sensing and processing functionality, relieving users from the need of wearing/carrying smart devices. Enabling such smart spaces requires device-free, effortless sensing of user's identity and activities. Device-free sensing using WiFi has shown great potential in such scenarios, however, a fundamental question of person identification has remained unsolved. In this paper, we present WiWho, a framework that can identify a person from a small group of people in a device-free manner using WiFi. We show that Channel State Information (CSI) used in recent WiFi can identify a person's steps and walking gait. The walking gait being distinguishing characteristics for different people, WiWho uses CSI-based gait for person identification. We demonstrate how step and walk analysis can be used to identify a person's walking gait from CSI, and how this information can be used to identify a person. WiWho does not require a person to carry any device and is effortless since it only requires the person to walk for a few steps (e.g. entering a home or an office). We evaluate WiWho using experiments at multiple locations with a total of 20 volunteers, and show that it can identify a person with average accuracy of 92\% to 80\% from a group of 2 to 6 people respectively. We also show that in most cases walking as few as 2-3 meters is sufficient to recognize a person's gait and identify the person. We discuss the potential and challenges of WiFi-based person identification with respect to smart space applications.},

abstract = {Using crowdsourced visual and inertial sensor data for indoor mapping has attracted much attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the opportunities and challenges of indoor tracking using crowdsourced maps have not been fully explored. In this work, we aim at tackling the challenges due to incomplete obstacle information in crowdsourced indoor maps, especially at the initialization stage of crowdsourcing. We propose a novel solution for particle-filtering-based indoor tracking, using the crowdsourced maps derived from image-based 3D point clouds. Our solution enhances particle filtering with density-based collision detection and history-based particle regeneration. Evaluation with real user traces demonstrates that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art. In particular, it reduces the average distance error of indoor tracking by 47\% when using crowdsourced 3D point clouds.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Detecting and locating outdoor boundary crossing events is valuable information in curbing drug trafficking, reducing poaching, and protecting high-asset equipment and goods. However, boundary sensing is notoriously challenging, prone to false alarms and missed detections, with serious consequences. Weather events, like rain and wind, make it even more challenging to maintain a low level of missed detections and false alarms. In this paper, we propose and test an automated system of wireless sensors which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements to localize where a boundary crossing occurs. In addition, we develop new RSS-based statistical models and methods that can quickly be initialized and updated on-line by using link RSS statistics to adapt to time-varying RSS changes due to weather events. These models are implemented in two new classifiers that localize boundary crossings with few missed detections and false alarms. We validate our proposed methods by implementing one of the classifiers in a three month long deployment of a solar-powered, real-time system that captures images of the boundary for ground truth validation. Furthermore, over 75 hours of RSS measurements are collected with an emphasis on collection during weather events, like rain and wind, during which we expect our classifiers to perform the worst. We demonstrate that the proposed classifiers outperform four other baseline classifiers in terms of false alarm probability by 1 to 4 orders of magnitude, and in terms of the misclassification probability by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.},

title = {Topic-aware social sensing with arbitrary source dependency graphs},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {This work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a new paradigm of collecting observations about the physical environment from humans or devices on their behalf. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. A fundamental problem in social sensing applications lies in ascertaining the correctness of claims and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. We refer to this problem as truth discovery. Prior works have made significant progress to addressing the truth discovery problem, but two significant limitations exist: (i) they ignored the fact that claims reported in social sensing applications can be either relevant or irrelevant to the topic of interests. (ii) They either assumed the data sources to be independent or the source dependency graphs can be represented as a set of disjoint trees. These limitations led to suboptimal truth discovery results. In contrast, this paper presents the first social sensing framework that explicitly incorporates the topic relevance feature of claims and arbitrary source dependency graphs into the solutions of truth discovery problem. The new framework solves a multi-dimensional maximum likelihood estimation problem to jointly estimate the truthfulness and topic relevance of claims as well as the reliability and topic awareness of sources. We compared our new scheme with the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions using three real world data traces collected from Twitter in the aftermath of Paris Shooting event (2015), Hurricane Arthur (2014) and Boston Bombing event (2013) respectively. The evaluation results showed that our schemes significantly outperform the compared baselines by identifying more relevant and truthful claims in the truth discovery results.},

isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Skeletal muscles are pivotal for sports and exercise. However, overexertion of skeletal muscles causes muscle fatigue which can lead to injury. Consequently, understanding skeletal muscle fatigue is important for injury prevention. Current ways to estimate exhaustion revolve around self-estimation or inference from such sensors as force sensors, electromyography e.t.c. These methods are not always reliable, especially during isotonic exercises. Toward this end, we present Burnout - a wearable system for quantifying skeletal muscle fatigue in an exercise setting. Burnout uses accelerometers to sense skeletal muscle vibrations. From these vibrations, Burnout obtains a region based feature (R-Feature), in the case of this work, the region mean power frequency (R-MPF) gradient to correlate the sensed vibrations to a known ground truth measure of skeletal muscle fatigue, i.e., Dimitrov's spectral fatigue index gradient. We evaluate Burnout on the biceps and quadriceps of 5 healthy participants through four different exercises, collected in a real world environment. Our results show that by using this R-MPF feature on our real world data set, Burnout is able to reduce the error of estimating the ground truth fatigue index gradient by upto 50\% on average compared to using the standard MPF feature.},

abstract = {Lawns make up the largest irrigated crop by surface area in North America, and carries with it a demand for over 9 billion gallons of freshwater each day. Despite recent developments in irrigation control and sprinkler technology, state-of-the-art irrigation systems do nothing to compensate for areas of turf with heterogeneous water needs. In this work, we overcome the physical limitations of the traditional irrigation system with the development of a sprinkler node that can sense the local soil moisture, communicate wirelessly, and actuate its own sprinkler based on a centrally-computed schedule. A model is then developed to compute moisture movement from runoff, absorption, and diffusion. Integrated with an optimization framework, optimal valve scheduling can be found for each node in the space. In a turf area covering over 10,000ft2, two separate deployments spanning a total of 7 weeks show that MAGIC can reduce water consumption by 23.4\% over traditional campus scheduling, and by 12.3\% over state-of-the-art evapotranspiration systems, while substantially improving conditions for plant health. In addition to environmental, social, and health benefits, MAGIC is shown to return its investment in 16-18 months based on water consumption alone.},

abstract = {Low-power wireless devices suffer notoriously from Cross-Technology Interference (CTI). To enable co-existence, researchers have proposed a variety of interference mitigation strategies. Existing solutions, however, are designed to work with the limitations of currently available radio chips. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit physical layer properties of 802.15.4 signals to better address CTI. We present CrossZig, a cross-layer solution that takes advantage of physical layer information and processing to improve low-power communication under CTI. To this end, CrossZig utilizes physical layer information to detect presence of CTI in a corrupted packet and to apply an adaptive packet recovery which incorporates a novel cross-layer based packet merging and an adaptive FEC coding. We implement a prototype of CrossZig for the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 in a software-defined radio platform. We show the adaptability and the performance gain of CrossZig through experimental evaluation considering both micro-benchmarking and system performance under various interference patterns. Our results demonstrate that CrossZig can achieve a high accuracy in error localization (94.3\% accuracy) and interference type identification (less than 5\% error rate for SINR ranges below 3 dB). Moreover, our system shows consistent performance improvements under interference from various interfering technologies.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {User identification is an essential problem for security protection and data privacy preservation of wearable devices. With proper user identification, wearable devices can adopt personalized settings for different users, automatically label the corresponding data to protect user privacy, and help prevent illegal user spoofing attacks. Current user identification solutions proposed for wearable devices either rely on dedicated devices with high cost or require user intervention which is not convenient. In this work, we leverage the bio-vibrometry to enable a novel user identification solution for wearable devices in small-scale scenarios, e.g., household scenario. Unlike existing user identification solutions, our system only uses the low-cost sensors that are already available for most wearable devices. The key idea is that, when human body is exposed to a vibration excitation, the vibration response reflects the physical characteristics of user, i.e., the mass, stiffness and damping. Meanwhile, due to users' biological diversity, such physical characteristics of different users are quite distinctive. Therefore, we can leverage the discrepancy in users' vibration responses as an identifier. Based on this idea, we propose VibID, which only uses a low-cost vibration motor and accelerometer to generate an unobtrusive vibration to users' arms and capture the corresponding responses. By examining the vibration patterns at different frequencies, VibID builds an ensemble machine learning model to recognize who is using the device. Extensive experiments are conducted on human subjects to demonstrate that our system is reliable in small-scale scenarios and robust to various confounding factors, e.g., arm position, muscle state, user mobility and wearing location. We also show that, in an uncontrolled scenario of 8 users, our system can still ensure a identification accuracy above 91\%.},

This broadcast problem is easily solvable, if the neighborhood of every node in the network induces a connected subgraph of the communication graph. Graphs with this property are called locally connected. This paper considers the edge augmentation problem for undirected graphs G = (V,E) that asks for a minimum set E' of additional edges such that the neighborhoods defined by G induce connected subgraphs of the augmented graph G' = (V,E∪E'). We develop a practical approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 1+ln(|V|) for general graphs and a constant approximation factor for several special cases such as unit disk graphs (factor 3/2), d-quasi unit disk graphs having d ≥ √3-1 ~ 0.732 (factor 11/6) or graphs with a constant maximum vertex degree. Additionally we prove the NP-completeness of the augmentation problem above and the related augmentation problem that asks for a locally connected graph.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {While routing protocols for low-power wireless networks, such as CTP or RPL, handle link failures relatively well, node failures have received considerably less research attention. This paper thus studies crash-failures of destination nodes in distance-vector routing, that is, failures of so-called DODAG root nodes. First, it demonstrates empirically that handling root node crashes in existing state-of-the-art routing protocols leaves room for improvement or even fails completely in some cases. Second, based on an analysis of this behavior, the paper proposes RNFD, a new algorithm that explicitly tracks node failures at the routing layer. The algorithm is designed as a framework that complements rather than replaces regular route maintenance algorithms, which facilitates its integration with the existing protocols. Third, the paper evaluates a prototype implementation of RNFD through simulations and testbed experiments. In particular, it demonstrates that, with little information overhead, RNFD can speed up node failure detection by an order of magnitude and considerably reduce the traffic during the process.},

isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The paper develops a recursive state estimator for social network data streams that allows exploitation of social networks, such as Twitter, as sensor networks to reliably observe physical events. Recent literature suggested using social networks as sensor networks leveraging the fact that much of the information upload on the former constitutes acts of sensing. A significant challenge identified in that context was that source reliability is often unknown, leading to uncertainty regarding the veracity of reported observations. Multiple truth finding systems were developed to solve this problem, generally geared towards batch analysis of offline datasets. This work complements the present batch approaches by developing an online recursive state estimator that recovers ground truth from streaming data. In this paper, we model physical world state by a set of binary signals (propositions, called assertions, about world state) and the social network as a noisy medium, where distortion, fabrication, omissions, and duplication are introduced. Our recursive state estimator is designed to recover the original binary signal (the true propositions) from the received noisy signal, essentially decoding the unreliable social network output to obtain the best estimate of ground truth in the physical world. Results show that the estimator is both effective and efficient at recovering the original signal with a high degree of accuracy. The estimator gives rise to a novel situation awareness tool that can be used for reliably following unfolding events in real time, using dynamically arriving social network data.},

abstract = {We introduce Harmonium, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or tag, fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag's position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional ultra-wideband approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost $4.50 USD at modest volumes. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems.},

abstract = {Traditional power grid is not resistant to severe weather conditions, especially in remote areas. For some areas with few people, such as islands, it is difficult and expensive to maintain their connectivity to the traditional power grid. Therefore, a self-sustainable microgrid is desired. However, given the limited local energy storage and energy generation, it is extremely challenging for a microgrid to balance the power demand and generation in real-time. To realize the real-time power quality monitoring, the power quality information of microgrid, such as voltage, frequency and phase angle in each home, needs to be collected in real-time. Furthermore, the unreliable sensing results and data collection in a microgrid make the real-time data collection more difficult. To address these challenges, we designed an accurate real-time power quality data sensing hardware to sense the voltage, frequency and phase angle in each home. A novel data management technique is also proposed to reconstruct the missing data caused by unreliable sensing. We implemented our system over off-the-shelf smartphones with a few peripheral hardware components, and realized an accuracy of 1.7 mHz and 0.01 rad for frequency and phase angle monitoring, respectively. We also show our data management technique can reconstruct the missing data with more than 99\% accuracy.},

isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Network measurement, which provides detailed information about the behaviors of operational networks, is essential for network management in wireless sensor networks. In the literature, there have been many approaches focusing on measuring individual aspect of the network, e.g., per-packet routing path and per-hop delay. However, there lacks a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. When managing an operational network, a network operator often needs to switch the current measurement task to a different one, in order to diagnose the observed symptoms. In this paper, we propose TinySDM, a software-defined measurement architecture for WSNs. TinySDM provides a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. TinySDM defines a set of carefully selected hooks that allow the users to easily execute their own measurement tasks. In addition, TinySDM provides a C-like language called TinyCode Language (TCL) to enable easy customization of measurement tasks. By only transmitting the binary code of the measurement task, TinySDM significantly reduces the size of the disseminated data compared with existing reprogramming approaches. We implement TinySDM on the TinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its performance extensively in a testbed with 60 nodes. We also use TCL to implement four specific measurement tasks. Results show that TinySDM is flexible, efficient and easily programmable.},

abstract = {ZigBee shares the 2.4 GHz ISM band with a number of wireless technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth, and common household appliances like a microwave and a cordless phone to name a few. Due to the large-scale penetration of these technologies in urban environments, ZigBee communication suffers from severe cross-technology interference (CTI). Data collection in the presence of such highly dynamic CTI is quite challenging. Our work first examines the different deployment environments under the influence of planned and unplanned CTI and later proposes Oppcast, a robust and energy-efficient data collection protocol that carefully exploits a combination of spatial and channel diversity to eliminate the need for performing expensive channel estimation in advance.Our extensive evaluation in both a large-scale testbed (Academic Institution) and various urban environments (Carpark, Residential Complex, Shopping Mall and Cafeteria) shows that Oppcast is not only robust to CTI with reliability consistently maintained above 98.55\%, but is also up to 2.4 times more energy efficient than the state-of-the-art data collection protocols. The rationale behind Oppcast exhibiting high robustness in highly dynamic environments is a significant increase in the number of communication opportunities it gets by exploiting multiple routes over multiple channels towards the destination.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Link estimation is a fundamental component of forwarding protocols in wireless sensor networks. In low power forwarding, however, the asynchronous nature of widely adopted duty-cycled radio control brings new challenges to achieve accurate and real-time estimation. First, the repeatedly transmitted frames (called wake-up frame) increase the complexity of accurate statistic, especially with bursty channel contention and coexistent interference. Second, frequent update of every link status exhausts the limited energy supply due to long duration of beacon broadcast.In this paper, we propose meter (Distributed Frame Counter), which takes the opportunities of link overhearing to update link status in real time. Furthermore, meter does not only depend on counting the successfully decoded wake-up frames, but also counts the corrupted ones by exploiting the feasibility of ZigBee identification based on short-term sequence of the received signal strength. We implement meter in TinyOS and further evaluate the performance through extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor testbeds. The results demonstrate that meter can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art link estimation schemes.},

isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The popularity of wearables continues to rise. However, possible applications, and even their raw functionality are constrained by the types of sensors that are currently available. Accelerometers and gyroscopes struggle to capture complex user activities. Microphones and image sensors are more powerful but capture privacy sensitive information. Physiological sensors are obtrusive to users as they often require skin contact and must be placed at certain body positions to function.In contrast, radio-based sensing uses wireless radio signals to capture movements of different parts of the body, and therefore provides a contactless and privacy-preserving approach to detect and monitor human activities. In this paper, we contribute to the search for new sensing modalities for the next generation of wearable devices by exploring the feasibility of mobile radio-based human activity recognition. We believe radio-based sensing has the potential to fundamentally transform wearables as we currently know them. As the first step to achieve our vision, we have designed and developed HeadScan, a first-of-its-kind wearable for radio-based sensing of a number of human activities that involve head and mouth movements. HeadScan only requires a pair of small antennas placed on the shoulder and collar and one wearable unit worn on the arm or the belt of the user. HeadScan uses the fine-grained CSI measurements extracted from radio signals and incorporates a novel signal processing pipeline that converts the raw CSI measurements into the targeted human activities. To examine the feasibility and performance of HeadScan, we have collected approximate 50.5 hours data from seven users. Our wide-ranging experiments include comparisons to a conventional skin-contact audio-based sensing approach to tracking the same set of head and mouth-related activities. Our experimental results highlight the enormous potential of our radio-based mobile sensing approach and provide guidance to future explorations.},

isbn = {9781509008025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Heartbeat monitoring during sleep is critically important to ensuring the well-being of many people, ranging from patients to elderly. Technologies that support heartbeat monitoring should be unobtrusive, and thus solutions that are accurate and can be easily applied to existing beds is an important need that has been unfulfilled. We tackle the challenge of accurate, low-cost and easy to deploy heartbeat monitoring by investigating whether off-the-shelf analog geophone sensors can be used to detect heartbeats when installed under a bed. Geophones have the desirable property of being insensitive to lower-frequency movements, which lends itself to heartbeat monitoring as the heartbeat signal has harmonic frequencies that are easily captured by the geophone. At the same time, lower-frequency movements such as respiration, can be naturally filtered out by the geophone. With carefully-designed signal processing algorithms, we show it is possible to detect and extract heartbeats in the presence of environmental noise and other body movements a person may have during sleep.We have built a prototype sensor and conducted detailed experiments that involve 43 subjects (with IRB approval), which demonstrate that the geophone sensor is a compelling solution to long-term at-home heartbeat monitoring. We compared the average heartbeat rate estimated by our prototype and that reported by a pulse oximeter. The results revealed that the average error rate is around 1.30\% over 500 data samples when the subjects were still on the bed, and 3.87\% over 300 data samples when the subjects had different types of body movements while lying on the bed. We also deployed the prototype in the homes of 9 subjects for a total of 25 nights, and found that the average estimation error rate was 8.25\% over more than 181 hours' data.},

abstract = {Breakthroughs from the field of deep learning are radically changing how sensor data are interpreted to extract the high-level information needed by mobile apps. It is critical that the gains in inference accuracy that deep models afford become embedded in future generations of mobile apps. In this work, we present the design and implementation of DeepX, a software accelerator for deep learning execution. DeepX significantly lowers the device resources (viz. memory, computation, energy) required by deep learning that currently act as a severe bottleneck to mobile adoption. The foundation of DeepX is a pair of resource control algorithms, designed for the inference stage of deep learning, that: (1) decompose monolithic deep model network architectures into unit-blocks of various types, that are then more efficiently executed by heterogeneous local device processors (e.g., GPUs, CPUs); and (2), perform principled resource scaling that adjusts the architecture of deep models to shape the overhead each unit-blocks introduces. Experiments show, DeepX can allow even large-scale deep learning models to execute efficiently on modern mobile processors and significantly outperform existing solutions, such as cloud-based offloading.},

Recently, we have seen a huge surge in wearable and smartbuilding centric sensing applications. However, these devices are integrated with batteries for charging which not only increases size and mass but also cost of the system. Powering the system directly from the energy harvesting source can mitigate this problem, but requires system software support to handle computations across power cycles, a paradigm known as transiently powered computing. We have designed portable system techniques to enable checkpointing of the program state on stable storage, along with its later recovery, with minimal latency and energy consumption [1]. Right now, we are investigating how to determine where and when to perform checkpointing, and what support do we need to offer to developers to manage developing applications that may be interrupted for a non-negligible amount of time and later resume.},

abstract = {Radio frequency based device-free passive localization has been actively studied. An important issue with this technique is that a large amount of sensor nodes are usually deployed in localization environments, causing high deployment cost, high computation complexity and other drawbacks. To reduce the number of nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy, this paper proposes a fingerprint-based node deployment mechanism, which saves hardware cost, speeds up node deployment process as well as maintains a similar accuracy. The experiments are conducted in two environments with considerably different sizes of 150 m2 and 25 m2. Maintaining the accuracies above 95\%, the proposed mechanism can efficiently reduce the total number of nodes in large room by 54.55\% and in small room by 68.75\%. Especially, the localization response time sharply reduces by 93.08\% in the large room and 79.87\% in the small room.},

However, one of the major limitations of the existing solutions is the expensive visual processing pipeline: on resource-constrained mobile devices, it could take up to tens of seconds to process one frame. To address this, we propose a novel learning algorithm, which adaptively discovers the place dependent parameters for visual processing, such as which parts of the scene are more informative, and what kind of visual elements one would expect, as it is employed more and more by the users in a particular setting. With such meta-information, our positioning system dynamically adjust its behaviour, to localise the users with minimum effort. Preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the cost on visual processing significantly, and achieve sub-metre positioning accuracy.},

This makes BouKey immune to through the wall sniffing attacks. BouKey divides the key and shares it using multiple transmission bulbs allowing the key to be received in a specific area only.

abstract = {As mobile computing platforms become more prevalent, there comes a growing need for highly accurate knowledge of the positions of the devices in the network. In outdoor environments such as UAV's, self driving cars, and precision agriculture, the use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS serves as a natural choice for device localization. However, providing the sub-meter localization accuracy required by some of the aforementioned applications requires expensive hardware, while the more common low-cost receivers only provide solutions on the order of tens of meters. At the same time, the ability to share GPS measurements between low-cost nodes, coupled with the unique constraints of the GPS positioning domain, offers novel opportunities for low cost and highly accurate positioning. The goal of this research is to investigate such opportunities in order to create a robust, accurate, and low-cost positioning platform.},

abstract = {At least since the terms Internet of Things, Factories of the Future or Industrial Internet gave distinction to the modern world of communication, there is a special need for efficient test- and debug tools targeting research and development of embedded wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) in industrial automation technology and other non-consumer application areas in adverse environments. Those networks usually have tighter requirements on dependability, synchronization, and real-time capability as compared applications in environmental monitoring or home automation. For WSAN research and development, testbeds are a valuable tool as they enable controlled and repeatable operation under conditions close to reality. The contribution of this Ph.D. dissertation is to design, implement and set up a test environment for embedded industrial wireless sensor actuator networks, with special focus on energy constrained network nodes. This testbed should offer an previously unattained level of insight in timing characteristics of the network and the energy behavior of a single node. It allows to make statements about limitations of the deployed WSAN technology, or to compare different WSAN solutions in an automated manner. The uniqueness of this testbed setup is due to a scalable, affordable and maintainable organization both in software as well as the structure of the used hardware components.},

This includes transportation of the sampled baseband signals from the receivers over a backbone network and local signal processing at a fusion center. To overcome the large drifts in the synchronization signals provided by GPS, we permanently calibrate the system based on a stationary reference source.

abstract = {Real-time applications in wireless sensor networks require that packets should reach to a sink within the time deadline. To satisfy the requirements, existing studies exploit nodes whose speed is higher than the desired delivery speed decided by the spatiotemporal approach. However, they fail real-time transmission in the area where there is no neighbor nodes which meet the requirements toward a sink since the desired delivery speed is fixed. This paper proposes a scheme to pass the area using time gain which occurs by the nature of the existing real-time transmission scheme. Thus, in the area, a sending node could make full use of nodes which do not satisfy the requirements. In the end, the packet passes across the area with a lower speed than the desired delivery speed. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior in terms of real-time transmission success ratio to the existing schemes.},

abstract = {The one of the major difficulties in deploying a wireless sensor to monitor debris flow in the real world is power consumption. Frequently replacing the battery of a sensor that is located in a remote mountainous area is not practical. In this study we examine the newly-introduced wireless debris flow sensor, SMARTCONE, which is designed to minimize the standby power consumption, but still keep alert to detecting debris flow. During standby periods, SMARTCONE turns off all major components and uses an accelerometer to sense vibration generated by moving debris flow, and it wakes up SMARTCONE for collecting the parameters of a moving debris flow. Multiple SMARTCONEs need to change operation modes between standby and wake up, collect physical parameters, and transmit data simultaneously, and these issues are kept in mind while designing the system. The performance of vibration detection, data transmission and records of GPS trajectories are evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the design.},

abstract = {Indoor positioning is one of the key technologies for enabling location-aware applications. To the best of our knowledge, existing indoor positioning technologies are aimed at providing very high-accuracy location information, but are hindered by the need of a infrastructure with high installation and maintenance costs. In addition, their accuracy is usually highly variable and vulnerable to environmental changes or external interference. Thus, for applications of indoor human tracking, the practical considerations of choosing a suitable indoor positioning technique should be to provide adequate accuracy while also being economical. Based on this observation, our study presents an indoor, room-level tracking method characterized by an infrastructure with low costs to build and maintain. The user carries a mobile device that can determine his/her location with the help of Bluetooth beacons installed at the intersections between rooms and hallways. In contrast to traditional radio-fingerprint map and proximity approaches, in this study the mobile device tracks the user's moving direction and the temporal variation of the radio signal strength from nearby Bluetooth beacons, to determine when the device enters or leaves a given room or hallway. Therefore, by determining the sequence of a user's movements, his/her moving path can be recorded for indoor tracking or navigation.},

This embedded gateway can be used to collect data from networked wireless sensors in the field.

We designed and implemented this framework and installed it in a test site to evaluate its performance. This gateway framework can facilitate the design of a sensor system for collecting on-site signals, leveraging the benefits of cost-effective, always-ready, and reliable data storage service.},

abstract = {Long lifetime is the most pursued goal in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). As communication is typically the most energy consuming task, a lot of effort has been devoted to design energy efficient communication protocols using duty-cycling in the last decades. However, in the recent years, a new kind of Ultra Low Power (ULP) receivers, called Wake-up Receivers (WuRx), is emerging. These devices allow the continuous monitoring of the wireless channel while having a power consumption orders of magnitude less than typical WSNs transceivers. WuRx can wake-up the rest of the system (microcontroller (MCU) and main radio) using interrupts only when needed, minimizing the idle listening. In this work, we present an experimental and an analytical study which ultimately serve as guidelines for the design of communication protocols leveraging WuRx.},

abstract = {Probe vehicles consist in mobile traffic sensor networks that evolve with the flow of vehicles, transmitting velocity and position measurements along their path, generated using GPSs. To address the urban positioning issues of GPSs, we propose to replace them with inertial measurement units onboard vehicles, to estimate vehicle location and attitude using inertial data only. While promising, this technology requires one to carefully calibrate the orientation of the device inside the vehicle to be able to process the acceleration and rate gyro data. In this article, we propose a scheme that can perform this calibration automatically by leveraging the kinematic constraints of ground vehicles, and that can be implemented on low-end computational platforms. Preliminary testing shows that the proposed scheme enables one to accurately estimate the actual accelerations and rotation rates in the vehicle coordinates.},

abstract = {This paper proposes "SmileWave", a system for revealing smile-based emotional contagion, propagation effect of the similar emotion through smiley facial expression, on the social network where users interact each other through web-based user interface rather than in-person interaction. SmileWave is a picture-based networking service and detects the change of smile degree when the user looks at posted smile images of others. Our extensive user study with 50 participants for 30 days confirmed the emotional contagion effect on SmileWave. Users' smile degree improved by 27\% when the user looked at posted smile images. The result also proved that there is a stronger effect on smile-based emotional contagion when the examinee and the person in the image are in close relationship.},

abstract = {A smart grid is envisioned as a promising platform for the next-generation power supply network, where the electricity is generated based on the demand from the consumers energy-use information. However, the security and privacy issues over insecure wireless communications are still big obstacles in the success of smart grid networks. In this paper, we present an efficient authentication model in smart grid networks. The proposed model justifies its feasibility with an early test-bed using off-the-shelf 802.15.4 low-cost sensors. Moreover, this poster reports preliminary performance evaluation results, and shows that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient than the prior works.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been widely used for a number of industrial monitoring applications including the aircraft industry. Indeed, the WSN paradigm ensures the fast deployment of sensing devices in difficult to access areas, the measurement of physical phenomena and transmission of data to a user over the wireless network. Due to autonomous nature of WSN, the energy resources of sensor nodes are limited by the energy stored in batteries.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are today widely employed in real world applications. However, their lifetime is still challenging and the most critical limitation for the success of this technology. In fact, wireless sensors nodes, which are the backbone of the network, are typically powered by limited energy storage devices (i.e. small batteries or supercaps) and their short lifetime is a critical issue. To overcome this limitation a major research effort focuses on reducing power consumption, especially of communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the highest power consumers. A critical energy-efficiency issue in WSN transceivers is idle listening. Wake-up radio receivers are very effective in minimizing idle listening. This fact has resulted in a significant number of wake-up radio receiver architectures proposed in last decade. In this work we present an advanced design and implementation of an advanced wake-up radio that is capable of both processing the received data (i.e. for addressing) and retransmitting data or wake up messages to the neighbours when necessary. With these features it can be possible to further enhance the energy efficiency of the communication and allowing ultra-low power multi-hop communication. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality as well as the power and range of the proposed design which is ready for future energy efficient and pure-asynchronous MAC protocols.},

abstract = {Wearable devices are massively entering in our life and they are more and more pushing the interest big electronic producer. Then, today many company are offering wearable "smart" objects to be worn which enable a wide range of application (form sport \&amp; fitness, to entrainment, from tracking to health care). A common issue of wearable device that is reducing the appeal of them is the limited lifetime due to limited energy that can be stored in them batteries. Self-sustainable devices which can avoid to recharge or replace the batteries, as it happens in automatic quartz watches, is still a dream for wearable devices. This paper presents a wearable device with an ultra low camera, which can achieve this dream. To achieve this goal, the Wearable camera has been carefully designed with low power consumption in mind and leveraging a kinetic energy harvester to scavenge energy from the human body movements. The experimental results shows the impressive amount of energy (up to 9.6mJ per minute) that can be acquired during different human activities (running, walking, etc) and the self-sustainability of the solution acquiring up to more than 2000 images for hour when is running.},

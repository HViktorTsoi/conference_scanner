abstract = {The rise of heterogeneity in wireless technologies operating in the unlicensed bands has been shown to adversely affect the performance of low-power wireless networks. Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) is highly uncertain and raises the need for agile methods that assess the channel conditions and apply actions maximizing communication success. In this paper, we present TIIM, a lightweight Technology-Independent Interference Mitigation solution that detects, quantifies, and reacts to CTI in realtime. TIIM employs a lightweight machine learning classifier to (i) decide whether communication is viable over the interfered link, (ii) characterize the ambient conditions and apply the best coexistence mitigation strategy. We present an in-depth experimental characterization of the effect of CTI on 802.15.4 links, which motivated and influenced the design of TIIM. Our evaluation shows that TIIM, while exposed to extensive and heterogeneous interference, can achieve a total PRR improvement of 30\% with an additional transmission overhead of 5.6\%.},

abstract = {Desynchronization algorithms are essential in the design of collision-free medium access control (MAC) mechanisms for wireless sensor networks. Desync is a well-known desynchronization algorithm that operates under limited listening. In this paper, we view Desync as a gradient descent method solving a convex optimization problem. This enables the design of a novel decentralized, collision-free, multichannel medium access control (MAC) algorithm. Moreover, by using Nesterov's fast gradient method, we obtain a new algorithm that converges to the steady network state much faster. Simulations and experimental results on an IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network deployment show that our algorithms achieve significantly faster convergence to steady network state and substantially higher throughput compared to the recently standardized IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 time synchronized channel hopping (TSCH) scheme. In addition, our mechanism has a comparable power dissipation with respect to TSCH and does not need a coordinator node or coordination channel.},

abstract = {Leveraging the redundancy and parallelism from multiple RF chains, MIMO technology can easily scale wireless link capacity. However, the high power consumption and circuit-area cost prevents MIMO from being adopted by energy-constrained wireless devices. In this paper, we propose Halma, that can boost link capacity using multiple antennas but a single RF chain, thereby, consuming the same power as SISO. While modulating its normal data symbols, a Halma transmitter hops between multiple passive antennas on a per-symbol basis. The antenna hopping pattern implicitly carriers extra data, which the receiver can decode by extracting the index of the active antenna using its channel pattern as a signature.We design Halma by intercepting the antenna switching and channel estimation modules in modern wireless systems, including ZigBee and WiFi. Further, we design a model-driven antenna hopping protocol to balance a tradeoff between link quality and dissimilarity of channel signatures. Remarkably, by leveraging the inherent packet structure in ZigBee, Halma's link capacity can scale well with the number of antennas. Using the WARP software radio, we have implemented Halma along with a ZigBee- and WiFi-based PHY layer. Our experiments demonstrate that Halma can improve ZigBee's throughput and energy efficiency by multiple folds under realistic network settings. For WiFi, it consumes similar power as SISO, but boosts throughput across a wide range of link conditions and modulation levels.},

Under our model, we show that the problem of placing a minimum number of fixed-power jammers is NP-Hard, and we provide a PTAS ((1 + ε)-approximation scheme) for the same, where ε is a tunable parameter between 0 and 1.},

abstract = {The requirements of many wireless sensing applications approach, or even exceed, the limited hardware capabilities of energy-constrained sensing platforms. To achieve such demanding requirements, some sensing platforms have included low-power application-specific hardware---at the expense of generality---to pre-process the sensor data for reduction to only the relevant information. While this additional hardware can save power by reducing the activity of the microcontroller and radio, a unique hardware solution is required for each application, which presents an unrealistic burden in terms of design time, cost, and ease of integration. To diminish these burdens, we present a reconfigurable analog/mixed-signal sensing platform in this work. At the hardware-level, this platform consists of a reconfigurable integrated circuit containing many commonly used signal-processing blocks and circuit components that can be connected in any configuration. At the software level, this platform provides a framework for abstracting this underlying hardware. We demonstrate how to quickly develop new applications on this platform, ranging from standard sensor interfacing techniques to more complicated intelligent pre-processing and wake-up detection. We also demonstrate how to integrate this platform with commonly used wireless sensor nodes and embedded-system platforms.},

abstract = {Evaluating and debugging solar panel-driven systems is a cumbersome process. The system must be deployed in the wild, software and hardware bugs identified remotely, and the development cycle must be repeated to build a robust system. Emulation platforms for solar panels offer a plausible remedy, however, existing systems have narrow operating range and are not portable. To address these shortcomings, we design, implement, and evaluate the SunaPlayer, a solar panel emulation platform that supports a wide operating current range (430 micro-amps to 1.89 amps) and voltage range (0.02 V to 9.8 V), and can be powered using batteries. SunaPlayer uses a high gain analog device, a PNP darlington transistor, a multi-scale driving and measurement circuit, and a novel state machine based proportional-integral-differential controller to build an accurate non-linear model of the solar panel. We have implemented a fully functional SunaPlayer prototype, and demonstrate that it can emulate a wide range of solar panels with high accuracy, low latency, high sensitivity, and low power consumption. The design methodology for the SunaPlayer can be used to build systems that model hard to emulate non-linear devices.},

abstract = {Today's spectrum measurements are mainly performed by governmental agencies which drive around using expensive specialized hardware. The idea of crowdsourcing spectrum monitoring has recently gained attention as an alternative way to capture the usage of wide portions of the wireless spectrum at larger geographical and time scales. To support this vision, we develop a flexible software-defined sensor architecture that enables distributed data collection in real-time over the Internet. Our sensor design builds upon low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware components with a total cost per sensor device below $100. The low-cost nature of our sensor platform makes the sensing approach particularly suitable for large-scale deployments but imposes technical challenges regarding performance and quality. To circumvent the limits of our solution, we have implemented and evaluated different sensing strategies and noise reduction techniques. Our results suggest that our sensor architecture may be useful in application areas such as dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radios, detecting regions with elevated electro-smog, or simply to gain an understanding of the spectrum usage for advanced signal intelligence such as anomaly detection or policy enforcement.},

abstract = {Owing to the rich processing, multi-modal sensing, and versatile networking capabilities, smartphones are increasingly used to build data-intensive embedded sensing applications. However, various challenges must be systematically addressed before smartphones can be used as a generic embedded sensing platform, including high power consumption, lack of real-time functionality and user-friendly embedded programming support. This paper presents ORBIT, a smartphone-based platform for data-intensive embedded sensing applications. ORBIT features a tiered architecture, in which a smartphone can interface to an energy-efficient peripheral board and/or a cloud service. ORBIT as a platform addresses the shortcomings of current smartphones while utilizing their strengths. ORBIT provides a profile-based task partitioning allowing it to intelligently dispatch the processing tasks among the tiers to minimize the system power consumption. ORBIT also provides a data processing library that includes two mechanisms namely adaptive delay/quality trade-off and data partitioning via multi-threading to optimize resource usage. Moreover, ORBIT supplies an annotation based programming API for developers that significantly simplifies the application development and provides programming flexibility. Extensive microbenchmark evaluation and two case studies including seismic sensing and multi-camera 3D reconstruction, validate the generic design of ORBIT.},

abstract = {Tongue gestures are a key modality for augmentative and alternative communication in patients suffering from speech impairments and full-body paralysis. Systems for recognizing tongue gestures, however, are highly intrusive. They either rely on magnetic sensors built into dentures or artificial teeth deployed inside a patient's mouth or require contact with the skin using electromyography (EMG) sensors. Deploying sensors inside a patient's mouth can be uncomfortable for long-term use and contact-based sensors like EMG electrodes can cause skin abrasion. To address this problem, we present a novel contact-less sensor, called Tongue-n-Cheek, that captures tongue gestures using an array of micro-radars. The array of micro-radars act as proximity sensors and capture muscle movements when the patient performs the tongue gesture. Tongue-n-Cheek converts these movements into gestures using a novel signal processing algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of Tongue-n-Cheek and show that our system can reliably infer gestures with 95\% accuracy and low latency.},

abstract = {Hand washing is an effective countermeasure to the spread of many types of infection. Recently, sensing technology has automated the sampling and study of hand hygiene rates. Surprisingly, many questions about the area are unresolved, motivating further exploration based on wrist-worn commodity sensors (accelerometer and MEMS gyroscope). This paper describes initial work on techniques for measuring the duration of washing events and classifying different scrubbing motions. The work compares different sensor types and their fusion, compares sensing from one wrist to measuring both wrists, and explains results of experiments on a range of hand washing motions in a variety of subject populations, some in clinics of a teaching hospital. Machine learning is used to explore such questions: the paper investigates numerous features extracted from sensor data, looking at sampling rates, windowing, and platform details that affect classification. In training and classification experiments, data collection starts on the wrist, activated by a message from a disinfectant dispenser; data is then transferred by radio to a base station for subsequent reduction, analysis and characterization. Results show that hand hygiene motions can be classified with up to 93\% accuracy.},

abstract = {Graph filters are a recent and powerful tool to process information in graphs. Yet despite their advantages, graph filters are limited. The limitation is exposed in a filtering task that is common, but not fully solved in sensor networks: the identification of a signal's peaks and pits. Choosing the correct filter necessitates a-priori information about the signal and the network topology. Furthermore, in sparse and irregular networks graph filters introduce distortion, effectively rendering identification inaccurate, even when signal-specific information is available. Motivated by the need for a multi-scale approach, this paper extends classical results on scale-space analysis to graphs. We derive the family of scale-space kernels (or filters) that are suitable for graphs and show how these can be used to observe a signal at all possible scales: from fine to coarse. The gathered information is then used to distributedly identify the signal's peaks and pits. Our graph scale-space approach diminishes the need for a-priori knowledge, and reduces the effects caused by noise, sparse and irregular topologies, exhibiting: (i) superior resilience to noise than the state-of-the-art, and (ii) at least 20\% higher precision than the best graph filter, when evaluated on our testbed.},

abstract = {Compressive Sensing is a technique that can help reduce the sampling rate of sensing tasks. In mobile crowdsensing applications or wireless sensor networks, the resource burden of collecting samples is often a major concern. Therefore, compressive sensing is a promising approach in such scenarios. An implicit assumption underlying compressive sensing -- both in theory and its applications -- is that every sample has the same cost: its goal is to simply reduce the number of samples while achieving a good recovery accuracy. In many networked sensing systems, however, the cost of obtaining a specific sample may depend highly on the location, time, condition of the device, and many other factors of the sample.In this paper, we study compressive sensing in situations where different samples have different costs, and we seek to find a good trade-off between minimizing the total sample cost and the resulting recovery accuracy. We design Cost-Aware Compressive Sensing (CACS), which incorporates the cost-diversity of samples into the compressive sensing framework, and we apply CACS in networked sensing systems. Technically, we use regularized column sum (RCS) as a predictive metric for recovery accuracy, and use this metric to design an optimization algorithm for finding a least cost randomized sampling scheme with provable recovery bounds. We also show how CACS can be applied in a distributed context. Using traffic monitoring and air pollution as concrete application examples, we evaluate CACS based on large-scale real-life traces. Our results show that CACS achieves significant cost savings, outperforming natural baselines (greedy and random sampling) by up to 4x.},

abstract = {Pyroelectric Infra-Red (PIR) sensors are used in many applications including security. PIRs detect the presence of humans and animals from the radiation of their body heat. This could be used to trigger events, e.g., opening doors, recording video, etc. PIRs are used widely because of their low power consumption.Hitherto, PIR sensors were used for binary event generation -- human/animal present or not-present. At the same time simple binary output hinders the use of PIR sensors in a wide variety of sophisticated applications. In the literature, we find limited characterization of analog output from PIR sensors that could provide much more information.We built a simple array of PIR sensors and packaged them in a tower. We used two sets of four PIR sensors and tapped their analog signals after amplification. Our major contribution is the characterization of analog signals from the PIR sensors. We describe many interesting aspects obtained from the analog signals, which have not been explored until now. We also show their correspondence with the range, speed and size of the moving object. Using the characterization of PIR sensors analog data as well as simple binary decisions from these PIR sensors, we: (i) classify moving object with high precision; and (ii) localize the moving object. The major incentives are low operating power compared to WSNs.We achieve 30 cm accuracy in 80\% of the times, when ranging up to 5 m. Over multiple experiments for different persons in the range 1--10 m, we show that the error probability for localization is 0.08 at moderate distances (around 5--6 m). Our work will help in designing better detection and application triggers using PIR sensors in the near future. We believe that this work will open up new avenues in the development of new applications with PIR sensors.},

abstract = {Activity recognition is an important component of many pervasive computing applications. Device-free activity recognition has the advantage that it does not have the privacy concern of using cameras and the subjects do not have to carry a device on them. Recently, it has been shown that channel state information (CSI) can be used for activity recognition in a device-free setting. With the proliferation of wireless devices, it is important to understand how radio frequency interference (RFI) can impact on pervasive computing applications. In this paper, we investigate the impact of RFI on device-free CSI-based location-oriented activity recognition. We conduct experiments in environments without and with RFI. We present data to show that RFI can have a significant impact on the CSI vectors. In the absence of RFI, different activities give rise to different CSI vectors that can be differentiated visually. However, in the presence of RFI, the CSI vectors become much noisier and activity recognition also becomes harder. Our extensive experiments shows that the performance of state-of-the-art classification methods may degrade significantly with RFI. We then propose a number of counter measures to mitigate the impact of RFI and improve the location-oriented activity recognition performance. Our evaluation shows the proposed method can improve up to 10\% true detection rate in the presence of RFI. We also study the impact of bandwidth on activity recognition performance. We show that with a channel bandwidth of 20 MHz (which is used by WiFi), it is possible to achieve a good activity recognition accuracy when RFI is present.},

abstract = {Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) enables device free localisation of people and objects in many challenging environments and situations. Its basic principle is to detect the changes in the statistics of radio signals due to the radio link obstruction by people or objects. However, the localisation accuracy of RTI suffers from complicated multipath propagation behaviours in radio links. We propose to use inexpensive and energy efficient electronically switched directional (ESD) antennas to improve the quality of radio link behaviour observations, and therefore, the localisation accuracy of RTI. We implement a directional RTI (dRTI) system to understand how directional antennas can be used to improve RTI localisation accuracy. We also study the impact of the choice of antenna directions on the localisation accuracy of dRTI and propose methods to effectively choose informative antenna directions to improve localisation accuracy while reducing overhead. Furthermore, we analyse radio link obstruction performance in both theory and simulation, as well as false positives and false negatives of the obstruction measurements to show the superiority of the directional communication for RTI. We evaluate the performance of dRTI in diverse indoor environments and show that dRTI significantly outperforms the existing RTI localisation methods based on omni-directional antennas.},

abstract = {We present the results, experiences and lessons learned from comparing a diverse set of technical approaches to indoor localization during the 2014 Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition. 22 different solutions to indoor localization from different teams around the world were put to test in the same unfamiliar space over the course of 2 days, allowing us to directly compare the accuracy and overhead of various technologies. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the evaluation study's results, discuss the current state-of-the-art in indoor localization, and highlight the areas that, based on our experience from organizing this event, need to be improved to enable the adoption of indoor location services.},

abstract = {Information about quantitative characteristics in local businesses and services, such as the number of people waiting in line in a cafe and the number of available fitness machines in a gym, is important for informed decision, crowd management and event detection. In this paper, we investigate the potential of leveraging crowds as sensors to report such quantitative characteristics and investigate how to recover the true quantity values from noisy crowdsourced information. Through experiments, we find that crowd sensors have both bias and variance in quantity sensing, and task difficulties impact the sensing accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic model to jointly assess task difficulties, ability of crowd sensors and true quantity values. Our model differs from existing categorical truth finding models as ours is specifically designed to tackle quantitative truth. In addition to devising an efficient model inference algorithm in a batch mode, we also design an even faster online version for handling streaming data. Experimental results in various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

abstract = {The proliferation of mobile sensing and communication devices in the possession of the average individual generated much recent interest in social sensing applications. Significant advances were made on the problem of uncovering ground truth from observations made by participants of unknown reliability. The problem, also called fact-finding commonly arises in applications where unvetted individuals may opt in to report phenomena of interest. For example, reliability of individuals might be unknown when they can join a participatory sensing campaign simply by downloading a smartphone app. This paper extends past social sensing literature by offering a scalable approach for exploiting dependencies between observed variables to increase fact-finding accuracy. Prior work assumed that reported facts are independent, or incurred exponential complexity when dependencies were present. In contrast, this paper presents the first scalable approach for accommodating dependency graphs between observed states. The approach is tested using real-life data collected in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy on availability of gas, food, and medical supplies, as well as extensive simulations. Evaluation shows that combining expected correlation graphs (of outages) with reported observations of unknown reliability, results in a much more reliable reconstruction of ground truth from the noisy social sensing data. We also show that correlation graphs can help test hypotheses regarding underlying causes, when different hypotheses are associated with different correlation patterns. For example, an observed outage profile can be attributed to a supplier outage or to excessive local demand. The two differ in expected correlations in observed outages, enabling joint identification of both the actual outages and their underlying causes.},

abstract = {We present QueueVadis, a system that addresses the problem of estimating, in real-time, the properties of queues at commonplace urban locations, such as coffee shops, taxi stands and movie theaters. Abjuring the use of any queuing-specific infrastructure sensors, QueueVadis uses participatory mobile sensing to detect both (i) the individual-level queuing episodes for any arbitrarily-shaped queue (by a characteristic locomotive signature of short bursts of "shuffling forward" between periods of "standing") and (ii) the aggregate-level queue properties (such as expected wait or service times) via appropriate statistical aggregation of multi-person data. Moreover, for venues where multiple queues are too close to be separated via location estimates, QueueVadis also uses a novel disambiguation technique to separate users into multiple distinct queues. User studies, performed with 138 cumulative total users observed at 23 different real-world queues across Singapore and Japan, show that QueueVadis is able to (a) identify all individual queuing episodes, (b) predict service and wait times fairly accurately (with median estimation errors in the 10\%--20\% range), independent of the queue's shape, (c) separate users in multiple proximate queues with close to 80\% accuracy and (d) provide reasonable estimates when the participation rate (the fraction of QueueVadis-equipped people in the queue) is modest.},

Feeder utilizes ridesharing-based vehicles (e.g., minibus) to deliver passengers from existing transit stations to selected stops closer to their destinations. We infer real-time passenger demand (e.g., exiting stations and times) for Feeder design by utilizing extreme-scale urban infrastructures, which consist of 10 million cellphones, 27 thousand vehicles, and 17 thousand smartcard readers for 16 million smartcards in a Chinese city Shenzhen. Regarding these numerous devices as pervasive sensors, we mine both online and offline data for a two-end Feeder service: a back-end Feeder server to calculate service schedules; front-end customized Feeder devices in vehicles for real-time schedule downloading. The evaluation results show that compared to the ground truth, Feeder reduces last-mile distances by 68\% and travel time by 52\% on average.},

abstract = {Existing systems for wildlife monitoring focus either on acquiring the location of animals via GPS or detecting their proximity via wireless communication; the integration of the two, remarkably increasing the biological value of the data gathered, is hitherto unexplored. We offer this integration as our first contribution, embodied by our WildScope system whose key functionality is geo-referenced proximity detection of an animal to others or to landmarks. However, to be truly useful to biologists, the in-field monitoring system must be complemented by two key elements, largely neglected by the literature and constituting our other contributions: i) a model exposing the tradeoffs between accuracy and lifetime, enabling biologists to determine the configuration best suited to their needs, a task complicated by the rich set of on-board devices (GPS, low-power radio, GSM modem) whose activation depends strongly on the biological questions and target species at hand; ii) a validation in controlled experiments that, by eliciting the relationship between proximity detection, the distance at which it reliably occurs, and the location acquisition, provides the cornerstone for the biologists' analysis of wildlife behavior. We test WildScope in real-world experimental setups and deployments with different degrees of control, ascertaining the platform accuracy w.r.t. ground truth and comparing against a commercial proximity logger.},

abstract = {In typical US homes, water heating is the largest energy consumer besides space heating and cooling, and it accounts for approximately 17\% of residential energy consumption on average. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new technique to reduce energy waste due to pipe loss: delivering lower temperature water whenever possible. We created a Smarter Water Heater (SWH) that uses data fusion techniques to infer 1) the fixture being used 2) the mixed water temperature at the fixture 3) the pipe volume for that fixture. After learning a model for each fixture, it solves a control optimization problem to decide when and at what temperature to deliver water to minimize energy use without sacrificing comfort of the user. We evaluated the SWH in three stages. First, we built a physical prototype and measured energy efficiency. We then deployed 18 sensors into a home's piping system for a 50-day in-situ study to stress test the SWH's sensing sub-system. Finally, we collected traces of hot water use from 5 different homes over 10 days each to determine how different water usage habits and piping structures affect energy savings. The results indicate that the SWH reduces total water heating energy by 8--14\% with little to no effect on user comfort.},

abstract = {Monitoring aquatic environment is of great interest to the ecosystem, marine life, and human health. This paper presents the design and implementation of Samba -- an aquatic surveillance robot that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a robotic fish to monitor harmful aquatic processes such as oil spill and harmful algal blooms. Using the built-in camera of on-board smartphone, Samba can detect spatially dispersed aquatic processes in dynamic and complex environments. To reduce the excessive false alarms caused by the non-water area (e.g., trees on the shore), Samba segments the captured images and performs target detection in the identified water area only. However, a major challenge in the design of Samba is the high energy consumption resulted from the continuous image segmentation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power-efficient inertial sensors on smartphone to assist the image processing. In particular, based on the learned mapping models between inertial and visual features, Samba uses real-time inertial sensor readings to estimate the visual features that guide the image segmentation, significantly reducing energy consumption and computation overhead. Samba also features a set of lightweight and robust computer vision algorithms, which detect harmful aquatic processes based on their distinctive color features. Lastly, Samba employs a feedback-based rotation control algorithm to adapt to spatiotemporal evolution of the target aquatic process. We have implemented a Samba prototype and evaluated it through extensive field experiments, lab experiments, and trace-driven simulations. The results show that Samba can achieve 94\% detection rate, 5\% false alarm rate, and a lifetime up to nearly two months.},

abstract = {Frequent sensor calibration is essential in sensor networks with low-cost sensors. We exploit the fact that temporally and spatially close measurements of different sensors measuring the same phenomenon are similar. Hence, when calibrating a sensor, we adjust its calibration parameters to minimize the differences between co-located measurements of previously calibrated sensors. In turn, freshly calibrated sensors can now be used to calibrate other sensors in the network, referred to as multi-hop calibration.We are the first to study multi-hop calibration with respect to a reference signal (micro-calibration) in detail. We show that ordinary least squares regression---commonly used to calibrate noisy sensors---suffers from significant error accumulation over multiple hops. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop calibration algorithm using geometric mean regression, which (i) highly reduces error propagation in the network, (ii) distinctly outperforms ordinary least squares in the multi-hop scenario, and (iii) requires considerably fewer ground truth measurements compared to existing network calibration algorithms. The proposed algorithm is especially valuable when calibrating large networks of heterogeneous sensors with different noise characteristics. We provide theoretical justifications for our claims. Then, we conduct a detailed analysis with artificial data to study calibration accuracy under various settings and to identify different error sources. Finally, we use our algorithm to accurately calibrate 13 million temperature, ground ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements gathered by our mobile air pollution monitoring network.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are plagued by the possibility of bugs manifesting only at deployment. However, debugging deployed WSNs is challenging for several reasons---the remote location of deployed sensor nodes, the non-determinism of execution that can make it difficult to replicate a buggy run, and the limited hardware resources available on a node. In particular, existing solutions to record and replay debugging in WSNs fail to capture the complete code execution, thus negating the possibility of a faithful replay and causing a large class of bugs to go unnoticed. In short, record and replay logs a trace of predefined events while a deployed application is executing, enabling replaying of events later using debugging tools. Existing recording methods fail due to the many sources of non-determinism and the scarcity of resources on nodes.In this paper we introduce Trace And Replay Debugging In Sensornets (Tardis), a software-only approach for deterministic record and replay of WSN nodes. Tardis is able to record all sources of non-determinism, based on the observation that such information is compressible using a combination of techniques specialized for respective sources. Despite their domain-specific nature, the techniques presented are applicable to the broader class of resource-constrained embedded systems. We empirically demonstrate the viability of our approach and its effectiveness in diagnosing a newly discovered bug in a widely used routing protocol.},

The system then decides which sensor data and operations should be combined to satisfy the user requirements. Second, to ensure safety and compliance, the system verifies whether conflicts or policy violations can occur within or between apps. Through an office deployment, user studies, and trace analysis using a large-scale dataset from a commercial IoT app authoring platform, we demonstrate the power of SIFT and highlight how it leads to more robust and reliable IoT apps.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly more relevant. This growing importance calls for tools able to provide users with correct, reliable and secure systems. In this paper, we claim that traditional approaches to analyze distributed systems are not expressive enough to address this challenge. As a solution to this problem, we present SIoT, a framework to analyze networked systems. SIoT's key insight is to look at a distributed system as a single body, and not as separate programs that exchange messages. By doing so, we can crosscheck information inferred from different nodes. This crosschecking increases the precision of traditional static analyses. To construct this global view of a distributed system we introduce a novel algorithm that discovers inter-program links efficiently. Such links lets us build a holistic view of the entire network, a knowledge that we can thus forward to a traditional tool. We prove that our algorithm always terminates and that it correctly models the semantics of a distributed system. To validate our solution, we have implemented SIoT on top of the LLVM compiler, and have used one instance of it to secure 6 ContikiOS applications against buffer overflow attacks. This instance of SIoT produces code that is as safe as code secured by more traditional analyses; however, our binaries are on average 18\% more energy-efficient.},

abstract = {Globally, infrastructure is a vital asset for economic prosperity, but condition assessments tend to be subjective and infrequent [2]. The lack of objective information leads to sub-optimal capital replacement projects, and the information lag prevents timely repair. In this poster we focus on techniques for monitoring rail-based transit infrastructure, although many of the findings could easily be applied in other types of infrastructure. One monitoring solution is to instrument the tracks and track structures, but given the expanse of our transit networks, the installation and maintenance cost of such a sensor network would be prohibitively high. A second solution is to use a custom instrumentation vehicle capable of monitoring the infrastructure as it moves [1]. However, such dedicated vehicles tend to be expensive, particularly in rail where monitoring is more specialized, so to keep costs down, infrastructure owners use these vehicles infrequently.},

abstract = {The introduction of ubiquitously connected mobile computing platforms acted as a catalyst for accessing and enjoying multimedia/visual contents on a more diverse set of computing environments than ever before. Recently, with the standardization of various protocols, a number of screen sharing services have been introduced, in which the contents of a mobile computing platform's screen is shared with a neighboring device [1]. With these services, data contents collected from various external sensing sources, can be captured at a mobile platform and (visually) shared easily with others using direct wireless connections. However, a previously unconsidered technical issue begins to impact the user experience levels of these multimedia/screen sharing mobile services. Specifically, we begin to notice energy efficiency as an important performance factor to consider when utilizing visual contents on mobile platforms with resource limitations. Actively using computational resources for visual applications lead to device heating and shorter battery life-times, as well as increased use of the wireless bandwidth when downloading or sharing the visual contents.},

We have developed an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that can seamlessly handle data from the wide variety of sensors available on mobile phones. It can store and run aggregated analysis on the data in real-time. However, mobile phones themselves are a very heterogeneous set of devices. Each phone comes with a different array of sensors with varying sensitivity and control functions. Also, there are multiple development environments and programming languages. A final problem is seamless prototyping of applications offline and then seamless partitioning of the algorithm between phone and the cloud.

The crux of FuzzyCAT is to adapt the transform parameters to the signal's curvature inferred from the time derivativesA comparative study with the Lightweight Temporal Compression (LTC) technique revealed that transmission costs of the FuzzyCAT nodes are much less than that of the LTC, which makes it an outstanding candidate for data compression in Wireless Sensor Networks.},

abstract = {Body Sensor Network (BSN) -- a network of body-worn wireless health monitoring sensors -- have a tremendous potential to remove the space and time restrictions on health management. Given the importance of the data BSNs collect for improved health outcomes, securing the data from unauthorized tampering is essential. A compromised (or externally influenced) sensor in a BSN may generate erroneous patient data leading to, among other things, wrong diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the problem of detecting maliciously induced morphological alterations in the ECG signal (i.e., inducing changes to its shape). Our approach works by correlating the ECG signals with synchronously measured arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal measured using a distinct (and un-compromised) sensor. Initial analysis of our system demonstrates promising results, with 99.75\% accuracy in detecting ECG signal morphological alterations for healthy patients with normal sinus rhythms.},

abstract = {Performing signal processing via a distributed method while maintaining data privacy has great uses. We focus on this problem to a two party situation where the first one (client) has a signal needing to be processed and is computationally bounded and the second (server) has computational resources. As a client, revealing the signal unencrypted causes a violation of privacy. One solution to this problem is to process the signal while encrypted. Problems of this type have been attracting attention recently; particularly with the growing capabilities of cloud computing. This paper contributes to solving this type of problem by processing the signals in an encrypted form, using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Realization of this type of application was performed using a brightness/contrast filter as a simple form of signal processing. Three additional contributions of this manuscript includes (1) extending FHE to real numbers, (2) bounding the error related to the FHE process against the unencrypted variation of the process, and (3) increasing the practicality of FHE as a tool by using graphical processing units (GPU).},

In this paper, we seek to improve the accuracy of one component of inertial-based tracking, namely the estimation of an individual's stride-length, so as to reduce the cumulative drift. We show that an individual's stride-length is affected by both his/her movement speed and heading-changes in the trajectory, and present an adaptive, online stride-length estimation algorithm that learns appropriate stride-length distributions for different (speed, heading) combinations. Initial experiments conducted using our proposed approach in combination with state-of-the-art step counting and heading estimation techniques, reduce the 95th percentile of average localization error by ≈ 30\%. We thus envisage that inertial tracking may become practical even with coarse-grained map information.},

A time-combined model reduces the fitting error by 50 \%, compared with the distance-only model. The ongoing project keeps accumulating SoC streams and our model will investigate the effect of other parameters and correlate different streams. An accurate model for major roads taken by most trips, will lead to a more efficient estimation of battery consumption for any point-to-point routes.},

abstract = {Vehicle-based vision algorithms, such as the collision alert systems [4], are able to interpret a scene in real-time and provide drivers with immediate feedback. However, such technologies are based on cameras on the car, limited to the vicinity of the car, severely limiting their potential. They cannot find empty parking slots, bypass traffic jams, or warn about dangers outside the car's immediate surrounding. An intelligent driving system augmented with additional sensors and network inputs may significantly reduce the number of accidents, improve traffic congestion, and care for the safety and quality of people's lives.We propose an open-code system, called Fleye, that consists of an autonomous drone (nano quadrotor) that carries a radio camera and flies few meters in front and above the car. The streaming video is transmitted in real time from the quadcopter to Amazon's EC2 cloud together with information about the driver, the drone, and the car's state. The output is then transmitted to the "smart glasses" of the driver. The control of the drone, as well as the sensor data collection from the driver, is done by low cost (&lt;30$) minicomputer. Most computation is done in the cloud, allowing straightforward integration of multiple vehicle behaviour and additional sensors, as well as greater computational capability.},

However, traditional closed-circuit television cameras can only capture static scenes. When unexpected events happen, such as fire accidents or stranger intrusion, the recorded video data cannot provide immediate and precise information. In this work, we design a camera dispatch system for video surveillance with pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, which can monitor event-areas/targets real-timely and flexibly. Users can dynamically define the monitoring requirements, such as pixel-per-foot and viewing-angle of the event-areas/targets. Then, a dispatch algorithm will decide the most necessary cameras and corresponding settings to monitor the event-areas/targets immediately. The control panel is implemented as a web-based service. The demo shows that users can easily monitor potential event-areas/targets anywhere, anytime through a web browser.},

abstract = {Detecting and localizing a person crossing a line segment, i.e., border, is valuable information in security and data analytic applications. To that end, we use the received signal strength (RSS) measured on RF links between nodes deployed linearly along a border as a border crossing detection and localization system. RSS measurements from any single RF link are noisy and prone to variations due to environmental changes (e.g. branches moving in wind). The redundant overlapping nature of the links between pairs of nodes in our proposed system provides an opportunity to mitigate these issues. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) which models the RSS on network links as a function of the neighboring nodes between which a person crosses. We demonstrate that the forward-backward solution to this HMM provides a robust and real time border crossing detection and localization system.},

abstract = {Today's radio frequency (RF) spectrum measurements are mainly performed by governmental agencies which drive around using bulky and expensive specialized hardware. This approach does not scale well, providing us with only a poor situational awareness of the actual RF spectrum usage around us. We have developed a wideband spectrum monitoring sensor for remote operation that builds upon portable and low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware components with a total cost per sensor device below $100. This results in a stunning cost reduction factor of 50 to 500 comparing to professional equipment. Our sensor platform adopts the software-defined radio paradigm and performs all signal processing steps on the CPU and GPU of a low-cost single-board computer. We address the challenges of large frequency errors and long scanning times due to the hardware constraints by proposing new correction and optimization methods, providing a satisfactory level of accuracy in indoor and outdoor environments. Our remote sensing platform is envisioned to be used at larger scale for various applications such as dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radios, detecting regions with elevated electro-smog, or for policy enforcement in the electromagnetic space.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are plagued by the possibility of bugs manifesting only at deployment. However, debugging deployed WSNs is challenging for several reasons---the remote location of deployed sensor nodes, the non- determinism of execution that can make it difficult to replicate a buggy run, and the limited hardware resources available on a node. In particular, existing solutions to record and replay debugging in WSNs fail to capture the complete code execution, thus negating the possibility of a faithful replay and causing a large class of bugs to go unnoticed. In short, record and replay logs a trace of predefined events while a deployed application is executing, enabling replaying of events later using debugging tools. Existing recording methods fail due to the many sources of non-determinism and the scarcity of resources on nodes.In this demo, we present Trace And Replay Debugging In Sensornets (Tardis), a software-only approach for deterministic record and replay of WSN nodes. Tardis is able to record all sources of non-determinism, based on the observation that such information is compressible using a combination of techniques specialized for respective sources. Despite their domain-specific nature, the techniques presented are applicable to the broader class of resource-constrained embedded systems.},

While this additional hardware can reduce the overall power consumption of the system, a unique hardware solution is required for each application. To diminish this burden, we will demonstrate a reconfigurable analog/mixed-signal sensing platform. At the hardware-level, this platform consists of a reconfigurable integrated circuit containing many commonly used circuit components that can be connected in any configuration to perform sensor interfacing and ultra-low-power signal processing. At the software level, this platform provides a framework for abstracting the underlying hardware. We will demonstrate how our platform allows a developer to create applications ranging from standard sensor interfacing techniques to more complicated intelligent pre-processing and wake-up detection, without the necessity of circuit-level expertise.},

abstract = {We are working on a new concept for decentralized medium access control (MAC), termed decentralized time-synchronized channel swapping (DT-SCS). Under the proposed DT-SCS and its associated MAC-layer protocol, wireless nodes converge to synchronous beacon packet transmissions across all IEEE802.15.4 channels, with balanced numbers of nodes in each channel. This is achieved by reactive listening mechanisms, based on pulse coupled oscillator techniques. Once convergence to the multichannel time-synchronized state is achieved, peer-to-peer channel swapping can then take place via swap requests and acknowledgments made by concurrent transmitters in neighboring channels. Our implementation of DT-SCS reveals that our proposal comprises an excellent candidate for completely decentralized MAC-layer coordination in WSNs by providing for quick convergence to steady state, high bandwidth utilization, high connectivity and robustness to interference and hidden nodes. The demo will showcase the properties of DT-SCS and will also present its behaviour under various scenarios for hidden nodes and interference, both experimentally and with the help of visualization of simulation results.},

abstract = {In this demonstration, we present a topological mapping system to be used with biobotic insects in order to sketch maps of unknown arenas using only neighbor to neighbor interactions among the agents. Biobotic insects fuse the locomotory advantages of insects with wireless sensing technology in form of electronic backpacks to function as search and rescue agents. Our mapping approach is designed for emergency response scenarios, where traditional mapping approaches may fail due to lack of localization information. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach instead using Hexbugs, which emulate the natural random motion of biobots. The Hexbugs are dispersed into a maze with unknown structure (Fig. 1), and their local interactions are captured through a visual tracking system. Such information is then exploited into a data analysis engine in order to robustly find the topological structure of the maze.},

abstract = {Myopia becomes a more and more serious worldwide problem as the number of myopic people (especially young people) grows rapidly. Efficient methods are required to monitoring the deterioration of nearsightness so as to take further treatment. This demo realizes a noval nearsightness monitoring system, called iSee, which utilizes the widely used smartphones to detect the deterioration of nearsightness by monitoring and analysing the the distance between the eyes and the smartphone screen. A prototype of iSee has been developed to evaluated the effectiveness under different environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Games have transformed from PC-based games to more immersive controllers, but gameplay has been limited to a digital screen or a virtual reality headset. In this demo, we present a novel indoor game that allows a player to maneuver the drone altitude by sensing their emotional state using affective sensors. This game demo introduces two innovations in sensing and actuation for next-generation indoor gaming: maneuvering physical objects such as drones for gameplay and sensing the player's emotional state using affective sensors as a control input. Therefore, the immersive experience of players is heightened same as that of real world. We begin to address the systems challenges in building the gaming platform for "Game-of-drones".},

abstract = {The respiration rate of a person provides critical information about their well-being. Conventionally, contact sensing is used for breathing monitoring; however, it is expensive, uncomfortable, and immobile. In-home non-contact breathing monitoring is now possible via Doppler radar and motion capture video sensors, yet these technologies are limited in mobility, among other limitations. When monitoring a patient who is free to move around his or her home, it is dificult to scale current non-contact sensors to cover the large area. Our RUBreathing sensor system uses RF received signal strength (RSS) in a network to estimate breathing rate in real-time with high accuracy over a wide area. In this demonstration, we show the sensor continuously estimating a patient's respiration rate from non-contact RSS measurements between wireless devices.},

abstract = {We propose a hybrid architecture of wired and wireless sensors for smart fabric with applications including body dynamics and shape monitoring and patient rehabilitation. Our system is capable of acquiring data from up to 200 on-body sensors with 50Hz sampling rate using conventional low-cost hardware. The sensing and data processing is done in real time and the results available on a smaptphone, tablet or pc in 3D visual form or as alerts. The user experience of the demo will include trying out smart clothing that is enabled with the shape sensing fabric and observing the body shape dynamics on-screen in real time.},

abstract = {E-healthcare games are a new patient care tool for providing fun, on-line monitoring enabled lifestyle, and a way for redefining traditional doctor-patient relationship. In this work, we demonstrate the use of intelligent sensors to capture patient behaviors for home healthcare. We design a new e-healthcare game user interface, iCube, for monitoring and recording patient activities. The iCube is a 3D game which has six display panels on the surfaces of a 3D cube embedded with a zigbee interface and some sensors for behavior monitoring. To prove its concept, we implement a Spot the Difference game. When a player is playing the game, the iCube can capture the player's hand shaking, rolling response, and visual capability. Those collected data are then sent to a database for spotting the progress/difference of the player over a long period time.},

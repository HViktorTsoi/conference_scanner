  abstract={We describe the design and implementation of Vildehaye, a family of versatile, widely-applicable, and field-proven tags for wildlife sensing and radio tracking. The family includes 6 distinct hard-ware designs for tags, 3 add-on boards, a programming adapter, and base stations; modular firmware for tags and base stations (both standalone low-power embedded base stations and base stations tethered to a computer running Linux or Windows); and desk-top software for programming and configuring tags, monitoring tags, and downloading and processing sensor data. The tags are versatile: they support multiple packet formats, data rates, and frequency bands; they can be configured for minimum mass (down to less than 1 g), making them applicable to a wide range of flying and terrestrial animals, or for inclusion of important sensors and large memories; they can transmit packets compatible with time-of-arrival transmitter-localization systems, tag identification and state packets, and they can reliably upload sensor data through their radio link. The system has been designed, upgraded, and main-tained as an academic research project, but it has been extensively used by 5 different groups of ecologists in 4 countries over a period of 5 years. More than 7100 tags have been produced and most of these have been deployed. Production used 41 manufacturing runs. The tags have been used in studies that so far resulted in 9 scientific publications in ecology (including in Science). The paper describes innovative design aspects of Vildehaye, field-use experiences, and lessons from the design, implementation, and maintenance of the system. Both the hardware and software of the system are open.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={15-27},
  abstract={With the recent societal impact of COVID-19, companies and government agencies alike have turned to thermal camera based skin temperature sensing technology to help screen for fever. However, the cost and deployment restrictions limit the wide use of these thermal sensing technologies. In this work, we present SIFTER, a low-cost system based on a RGB-thermal camera for continuous fever screening of multiple people. This system detects and tracks heads in the RGB and thermal domains and constructs thermal heat map models for each tracked person, and classifies people as having or not having fever. SIFTER can obtain key temperature features of heads in-situ at a distance and produce fever screening predictions in real-time, significantly improving screening through-put while minimizing disruption to normal activities. In our clinic deployment, SIFTER measurement error is within 0.4°F at 2 meters and around 0.6°F at 3.5 meters. In comparison, most infrared thermal scanners on the market costing several thousand dollars have around 1°F measurement error measured within 0.5 meters. SIFTER can achieve 100% true positive rate with 22.5% false positive rate without requiring any human interaction, greatly outperforming our baseline [1], which sees a false positive rate of 78.5%.},

  abstract={This paper presents Eclipse, a platform for low-cost urban environmental sensing using solar-powered and cellular-connected devices. Dense sensor networks promise to monitor pollution at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, yet few cities have actually implemented such networks due to high costs and limited accuracy. We address these barriers by developing an end-to-end framework for urban air quality sensing with minimal infrastructure requirements. We designed an unobtrusive device that collects data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pres-sure. A modular design further includes four low-cost gas sensors - Ozone (03), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO) - selected based on local priorities. We deployed 115 devices across Chicago, reliably collecting data for over 90% of expected sensor-hours from July 2 - September 30, 2021. We further developed a calibration strategy that reduced errors by 41.2 – 98.8%, improving accuracy to levels recommended for hotspot detection (PM2.5 and 03) or education (NO2 and SO2). Through this work, we offer insights on the real-world deployment of a replicable, large-scale, end-to-end platform for hyperlocal urban environmental sensing.},

  title={DRLIC: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Irrigation Control}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={41-53},
  abstract={Agricultural irrigation is a major consumer of freshwater. Current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient, since they are mainly based on soil moisture sensors' measurement and growers' experience, but not future soil moisture loss. It is hard to predict soil moisture loss, as it depends on a variety of factors, such as soil texture, weather and plants' characteristics. To improve irrigation efficiency, this paper presents DRLIC, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based irrigation system. DRLIC uses a neural network (DRL control agent) to learn an optimal control policy that takes both current soil moisture measurement and future soil moisture loss into account. We define an irrigation reward function that facilitates the control agent to learn from past experience. Sometimes, our DRL control agent may output an unsafe action (e.g., irrigating too much water or too little). To prevent any possible damage to plants' health, we adopt a safe mechanism that leverages a soil moisture predictor to estimate each action's performance. If it is unsafe, we will perform a relatively-conservative action instead. Finally, we develop a real-world irrigation system that is composed of sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We deploy DRLIC in our testbed composed of six almond trees. Through a IS-day in-field experiment, we find that DRLIC can save up to 9.52% of water over a widely-used irrigation scheme.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={54-66},
  abstract={In surveillance or search scenarios, exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to provide wireless data access for task-oriented ground robots (GRs) with remote base station have emerged as a promising application. This paper considers a UAV-enabled wireless network, where communication links could be line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to obstacles in urban environments. Existing works typically adopted the free-space path loss model or the statistical channel model, which either ignored the impact of obstacles or assumed uniformly distributed obstacles and therefore might fail in practical NLoS scenarios. In this paper, taking the information of randomly distributed obstacles in environments into consideration, we aim to optimize the placement for the UAV-enabled multi-hop network to transfer more data collected by GRs and minimize the time delay in data transmission while satisfying the required communication quality. By reconstructing this complex non-convex optimization problem into two subprob-lems and solving them alternatively, we propose the multi-hop UAVs placement (mUP) method to get the solution, which contains the air-to-ground network formation (ATG-NF) algorithm and the communication quality-aware UAV placement (CQA-UP) algorithm. Simulation results show that in four types of typical urban environments or with different numbers of UAVs, the proposed mUP method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of communication quality and task performance compared to other placement approaches based on statistical channel models. We further discuss the robustness of the mUP method towards terrain measurement error.},

  pages={67-78},
  abstract={With the development of embedded systems and Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) techniques, high throughput communication among heterogeneous IoT devices in the same frequency band (ISM band) can be achieved, which provides opportunities to en-hance the coexistence and cooperation for heterogeneous IoT de-vices. However, such improvement on the throughput is limited, since parallel communication has not been considered by most of the existing CTC techniques. There still exists unavoidable distortion in the reliability of the existing CTC techniques because of the heterogeneous properties of the protocols, hardware, and operating systems. Therefore, to enhance the communication throughput among heterogeneous IoT devices as much as possible, we study the parallel physical-layer CTC (PCTC) in this paper. We propose two advanced physical-layer CTCs. The first one improves the communication reliability between two heterogeneous IoT devices by retrieving the candidate emulation frames with high quality, and the other orthogonalizes the above candidate frames to achieve concurrent transmission. PCTC is designed for WiFi to ZigBee communication, and it is also implemented in USRP B210, which can improve the reliability and concurrency of the physical-layer CTC. Both theoretical analysis and experiment results verify its trans-mission reliability and improvement of throughput by comparing our technique with the existing ones.},

  title={SPARCS: A Sparse Recovery Approach for Integrated Communication and Human Sensing in mmWave Systems}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={79-91},
  abstract={A well established method to detect and classify human movements using Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) devices is the time-frequency analysis of the small-scale Doppler effect (termed micro-Doppler) of the different body parts, which requires a regularly spaced and dense sampling of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). This is currently done in the literature either using special-purpose radar sen-sors, or interrupting communications to transmit dedicated sensing waveforms, entailing high overhead and channel utilization. In this work we present SPARCS, an integrated human sensing and commu-nication solution for mmWave systems. SPARCS is the first method that reconstructs high quality signatures of human movement from irregular and sparse CIR samples, such as the ones obtained during communication traffic patterns. To accomplish this, we formulate the micro-Doppler extraction as a sparse recovery problem, which is critical to enable a smooth integration between communication and sensing. Moreover, if needed, our system can seamlessly inject short CIR estimation fields into the channel whenever communication traffic is absent or insufficient for the micro-Doppler extraction. SPARCS effectively leverages the intrinsic sparsity of the mmWave channel, thus drastically reducing the sensing overhead with re-spect to available approaches. We implemented SPARCS on an IEEE 802.11ay Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform working in the 60 GHz band, collecting standard-compliant CIR traces matching the traffic patterns of real WiFi access points. Our results show that the micro-Doppler signatures obtained by SPARCS enable a typical downstream application such as human activity recognition with more than 7 times lower overhead with respect to existing methods, while achieving better recognition performance.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={92-104},
  abstract={The introduction of the Wi-Fi 6E standard operating in the 6 GHz frequency band is a serious threat for IoT systems based on ultra-wideband technology, as they share portions of the same spectrum. Wi-Fi 6E devices can in fact support channel bandwidths up to 160 MHz and operate at a much higher transmission power compared to ultra-wideband devices, which may lead to severe coexitence issues and degraded performance. However, whether and to which extent the performance of ultra-wide band systems worsens due to Wi-Fi 6E interference has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we fill this gap and study how Wi-Fi 6E traffic affects ultra-wideband performance. Our experiments on a large-scale testbed demonstrate that Wi-Fi 6E transmissions may largely disrupt ultra-wideband communications and decrease the accuracy as well as the precision of ranging measurements, with significant consequences on the efficiency of localization systems. We investigate in detail the root causes for the degraded performance and derive empirical observations that can be used to design countermeasures mitigating the impact of Wi-Fi 6E interference. These include, among others, an optimal selection of physical layer settings, as well as the use of a tight synchronization to prevent a false detection of Wi-Fi 6E traffic as ultra-wide band frames and an overshooting of the radio's automatic gain control. We further devise a technique to detect the presence of Wi-Fi 6E traffic and postpone ultra-wideband transmissions accordingly. Our experiments demonstrate that these countermeasures effectively mitigate the impact of Wi-Fi 6E interference on the performance of ultra-wide band systems.},

  title={Individualizing Head-Related Transfer Functions for Binaural Acoustic Applications}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={105-117},
  abstract={A Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) characterizes how a hu-man ear receives sounds from a point in space, and depends on the shapes of one's head, pinna, and torso. Accurate estimations of HRTFs for human subjects are crucial in enabling binaural acoustic applications such as sound localization and 3D sound spatialization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for HRTF estimation rely on specialized devices or lengthy measurement processes. This work proposes a novel lightweight method for HRTF individual-ization that can be implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf components and performed by average users in home settings. The proposed method has two key components: a generative neural network model that can be individualized to predict HRTFs of new subjects from sparse measurements, and a lightweight measurement procedure that collects HRTF data from spatial locations. Exten-sive experiments using a public dataset and in house measurement data from 10 subjects of different ages and genders, show that the individualized models significantly outperform a baseline model in the accuracy of predicted HRTFs. To further demonstrate the advantages of individualized HRTFs, we implement two prototype applications for binaural localization and acoustic spatialization. We find that the performance of a localization model is improved by 15° after trained with individualized HRTFs. Furthermore, in hearing tests, the success rate of correctly identifying the azimuth direction of incoming sounds increases by 183% after individualization.},

  abstract={Audio is valuable in many mobile, embedded, and cyber-physical systems. We propose AvA, an acoustic adaptive filtering architecture, configurable to a wide range of applications and systems. By incorporating AvA into their own systems, developers can select which sounds to enhance or filter out depending on their application needs. AvA accomplishes this by using a novel adaptive beamforming algorithm called content-informed adaptive beam-forming (CIBF), that directly uses detectors and sound models that developers have created for their own applications to enhance or filter out sounds. CIBF uses a novel three step approach to prop-agate gradients from a wide range of different model types and signal feature representations to learn filter coefficients. We apply AvA to four scenarios and demonstrate that AvA enhances their respective performances by up to 11.1%. We also integrate AvA into two different mobile/embedded platforms with widely different resource constraints and target sounds/noises to show the boosts in performance and robustness these applications can see using AvA.},

  pages={132-144},
  abstract={While a tremendous amount of effort has been devoted to localization, the orientation of a device, especially in 3D space, is seldom explored. Although many sensor-based methods utilizing gyro-scope, accelerometer, and magnetometer have been proposed to measure 3D orientation, these methods generally suffer from high cumulative errors and performance degradation when the device is moving. In this paper, we present MOM, the first microphone-based system that estimates the 3D orientation of a device. The key idea of MOM is to employ free sound sources in our surrounding environment as anchors. The prior knowledge of these sound sources, including the signal waveform and the locations of the sound sources, is not required to be known. In particular, we propose an angle-of-arrival (AoA) extraction algorithm that compares fine-grained time delays over microphones at a low computational cost. We implement our system on three platforms including a 6-microphone array Seeed Studio ReSpeaker, a commodity earphone Sennheiser AMBEO smart headset and a commodity smartphone Google Pixel 4. Extensive experiments show that MOM can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared with status quo approaches and is robust against cumulative errors. We apply MOM to two real-life applications, i.e., head tracking and 3D reconstruction, to demonstrate the applicability and generality of MOM in practice.},

  pages={145-157},
  abstract={Facial expressions are important indicators of user needs that can be used in many interactive computing applications to adapt the system behaviors and settings. Current computing approaches to recognizing human facial expressions, however, either rely on con-tinuous camera recordings that are energy consuming, or require custom sensing hardware that are expensive and difficult to use on commodity systems. In this paper, we present FaceListener, a new sensing system that recognizes human facial expressions by only using commodity headphones. The basic idea of FaceListener is to transform the commodity headphone into an acoustic sensing device, which captures the face skin deformations caused by fa-cial muscle movements with different facial expressions. To ensure the recognition accuracy, FaceListener leverages the knowledge distillation technique to learn the subtle correlation between face skin deformation and the acoustic signal changes. Experiment re-sults over multiple human beings demonstrate that FaceListener can accurately recognize more than 80% of different facial expressions. FaceListener is highly energy efficient, and can well adapt to different headphone models, host systems and user activities.},

LwM2M manages millions of these devices in a server-centric architecture, which challenges edge net-works with expensive uplinks and time-sensitive use cases. In this paper, we contribute two LwM2M extensions to enable client-to-client (C2C) communication: (i) an authorization mechanism for clients, and (ii) an extended management interface to allow secure C2C access to resources. We analyse the security properties of the proposed extensions and show that they are compliant with LwM2M security requirements. Our performance evaluation on off-the-shelf IoT hardware reveals that C2C communication out-performs server-centric deployments. First, LwM2M deployments with edge C2C communication yield a ≈ 90% faster notification delivery and ≈ 8 times higher throughput compared to common server-centric scenarios, while keeping a small memory overhead of ≈ 8%. Second, in server-centric communication, the delivery rate degrades when resource update intervals drop below 100 ms.},

  abstract={Secure Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is important for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Key agreement between devices is the important first step in building a secure D2D channel. Due to the lack of third-party certification, key agreement for IoT devices has to rely on the untrusted channel between them, which makes the process vulnerable to attacks such as eavesdropping, jamming, and predictable channel attack. We solve this problem with a novel key agreement method named EchoKey, where two nearby devices can generate symmetric key independently, leveraging the ambient sound signal that can be locally collected by devices. The intuition of this idea is that the propagation delays of the ambient sounds and its echoes will carry fine-grained information about the spatial context of the receiving device, which can be transformed to a special key for that device. So, nearby devices which have similar spatial context will generate similar keys. We implement a prototype of EchoKey and evaluate its performance in resisting different attacks. The results tell that, with EchoKey, the key agreement process is even undetectable by an attacker which is only 50cm away from the pairing devices, and is thus resistant to all attacks mentioned above.},

  pages={183-194},
  abstract={Networked devices, such as wearable devices, laptops, smart home appliances, etc., are ubiquitous nowadays. To secure communication among those devices, symmetric keys are widely used because of their feasibility in resource-constrained networked devices. The ob-servations of sensors from independent devices have been adopted for symmetric key generation. The identical biometrics information or environment interference has been observed by sensors, and their corresponding patterns are used for key generation. Pop-ular signals from networked devices are inertial measurements, sound, wireless signals, etc. The existing sensor-based key gen-eration solutions use the same type of sensors for both devices. Different from the existing solutions, we are the first to propose a cross-sensor symmetric key generation system i2 Key, where two devices collect inertial measurements from a motion sensor and inaudible sound from a microphone, respectively. A new coding framework is designed for general key generation. We also pro-pose an efficient and accurate time synchronisation method for key generation. Additionally, a multi-tier key reconciliation method is suggested to improve key generation performance. By using the proposed architecture, the key generation rate is improved by up to approximately 40% compared with the situation without using it. We also perform security analysis and randomness analysis over the proposed method.},

In order to address the issue, we propose Rustle, an acoustic communication design which builds covert connection among IoT devices using random noise signal. Noise signal can be easily generated and exchanged by the widely used speakers and microphones on IoT devices. Based on the weak transitivity of signal's correlation and a fine-grained control of signal's wave shape, Rustle generates a series of mutu-ally uncorrelated random signals that contain “hidden patterns” to embed information. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Rustle can achieve a lower than 1% BER while the eavesdropper's error rate on detecting the signal is higher than 80%.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present Vi-Fi, a multi-modal system that leverages a user's smartphone WiFi Fine Timing Measurements (FTM) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data to associate the user detected on a camera footage with their corresponding smartphone identifier (e.g. WiFi MAC address). Our approach uses a recurrent multi-modal deep neural network that exploits FTM and IMU measurements along with distance between user and camera (depth information) to learn affinity matrices. As a baseline method for comparison, we also present a traditional non deep learning approach that uses bipartite graph matching. To facilitate evaluation, we collected a multi-modal dataset that comprises camera videos with depth information (RGB-D), WiFi FTM and IMU measurements for multiple participants at diverse real-world settings. Using association accuracy as the key metric for evaluating the fidelity of Vi-Fi in associating human users on camera feed with their phone IDs, we show that Vi-Fi achieves between 81% (real-time) to 91% (offline) association accuracy.},

  pages={220-232},
  abstract={Real-time access to overhead Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite imagery from a handheld device can have transformative applications: tracking wild-fire, natural disasters and weather events. Today, real-time access to images from LEO satellites overhead is challenging to obtain. LEO satellite ground receivers are bulky, expensive and sparsely deployed in the world. Despite the exponential increase in LEO small satellites orbiting the planet today-there is a significant time gap between an image capture on such a satellite and users who need it the most in remote and ecologically-sensitive regions. This paper presents SelfieStick, a novel satellite receiver system that explores reducing this barrier of access to real-time satellite imagery data using a single low cost (< $ 30) tiny receiver. SelfieStick's core approach takes advantage of the multiplicity of overhead Low-Earth Orbit satellites due to their exponential rise in recent years. While signals from such satellites may be individually weak, especially at a low-cost receiver, SelfieStick stitches together noisy RF captures containing underlying images of the same part of the Earth across many such satellites to generate clean Earth images. This is made possible by combining weak signals in the RF domain (rather than the traditional image domain) after appropriately transforming and aligning the RF signals accounting for different satellite perspectives, their orbits and wireless channels. A detailed experimental evaluation on the RTL-SDR platform on satellite captures from the NOAA constellation demonstrates a PSNR improvement of 5 dB through combining of images across 10 satellites.},

  pages={233-246},
  abstract={Recent advances in eye tracking have given birth to a new genre of gaze-based context sensing applications, ranging from cognitive load estimation to emotion recognition. To achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy, a large-scale, labeled eye movement dataset is needed to train deep learning-based classifiers. However, due to the heterogeneity in human visual behavior, as well as the labor-intensive and privacy-compromising data collection process, datasets for gaze-based activity recognition are scarce and hard to collect. To alleviate the sparse gaze data problem, we present EyeSyn, a novel suite of psychology-inspired generative models that leverages only publicly available images and videos to synthesize a realistic and arbitrarily large eye movement dataset. Taking gaze-based museum activity recognition as a case study, our evaluation demonstrates that EyeSyn can not only replicate the distinct pat-terns in the actual gaze signals that are captured by an eye tracking device, but also simulate the signal diversity that results from dif-ferent measurement setups and subject heterogeneity. Moreover, in the few-shot learning scenario, EyeSyn can be readily incorpo-rated with either transfer learning or meta-learning to achieve 90% accuracy, without the need for a large-scale dataset for training.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={247-258},
  abstract={Irradiated Cross-linked Polyethylene Foam (IXPE) has been one of the most commonly used materials in industry. During the production process of IXPE sheets, their edges need keep aligned strictly, otherwise, they could quickly get out of the border of the rolling plate and cause the huge economic loss. In this paper, we propose a camera-enabled approach, called Edge-Eye, to rectify the edge deviation automatically for IXPE production with millimeter-level accuracy. We deploy a commercial camera with mobile edge node in front of the IXPE sheet to continuously detect and rectify the edge deviation. Particularly, to handle the complex production en-vironment when extracting the edge of IXPE sheet, we deploy a pair of reference bars with high-contrast colors to efficiently differ-entiate the sheet edge from the background. Then, we propose a Bi-direction Edge Tracking method to perform the edge detection from both vertical and horizontal aspects. To realize the rectification using mobile edge nodes with limited computing resources, we reduce the cost of computation by extracting the Minimized Region of Interest, i.e., the edge area overlapped with the higher contrast reference bar on both sides. We further design a negative feedback control system with multi-stage feedback regulation mechanism, keeping the edge deviation within millimeter-level. We implemented Edge-Eye on the ARM64 platform and performed evaluation in the practical IXPE production process. The experimental results show that Edge-Eye achieves the average accuracy of 5mm for the edge deviation rectification, with the average latency of 200ms for edge deviation detection. During the process of 20-month real deployment for 36 production lines, 66 manpower per day (90% of the overall manpower) has been saved, and the utilization rate of IXPE material increases from 87% to 94%.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={259-270},
  abstract={The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensing systems leads to a large number of multimodal datasets over different deployments. Labeling costs for these datasets, especially fine-grained labels, are often tremendous. On the other hand, different data distributions (domain variance) of these datasets prevent models built with labels of one dataset (source domain) from being directly used in another (target domain). This domain variance may be caused by one or more physical factors change in the deployments, such as buildings and/ or people. Existing model transfer studies mainly focus on adapting the model to the domain variance caused by only one physical factor change. When multiple factors change between the source and target domains, the model transfer often yields low accuracy due to significant domain variance. We present VMA, a model transfer framework for multimodal IoT sensing data that handles multi-factor domain variance. VMA first decouples the multi-factor domain variance between two datasets to multiple single-factor domain variance dataset pairs with other available datasets. Then, VMA leverages sensing modalities robust to each single-factor domain variance for accurate prediction by weighing them more in the fusion. We apply VMA to the fine-grained occupant activity recognition application with a multi-modal sensing system of structural vibration and wearable IMU. We collect real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed framework. VMA achieves a model transfer accuracy up to 76.1% on the target domain with multi-factor domain variance, demonstrating a 1.6x and 1.9x error reduction compared to direct prediction baselines with and without modality-aware learning design.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={271-284},
  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning paradigm that enables the collaborative learning of different nodes without ex-posing the raw data. However, a critical challenge faced by the current federated learning algorithms in real-world applications is the long-tailed data distribution, i.e., in both local and global views, the numbers of classes are often highly imbalanced. This would lead to poor model accuracy on some rare but vital classes, e.g., those related to safety in health and autonomous driving applications. In this paper, we propose BalanceFL, a federated learning frame-work that can robustly learn both common and rare classes from a long-tailed real-world dataset, addressing both the global and local data imbalance at the same time. Specifically, instead of letting nodes upload a class-drifted model trained on imbalanced private data, we design a novel local update scheme that rectifies the class imbalance, forcing the local model to behave as if it were trained on ideal uniform distributed data. To evaluate the performance of BalanceFL, we first adapt two public datasets to the long-tailed federated learning setting, and then collect a real-life IMU dataset for action recognition, which includes more than 10,000 data sam-ples and naturally exhibits the global long tail effect and the local imbalance. On all of these three datasets, BalanceFL outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning approaches by a large margin.},

  title={YONO: Modeling Multiple Heterogeneous Neural Networks on Microcontrollers}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={285-297},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems provide large amounts of data on all aspects of human behavior. Machine learning techniques, especially deep neural networks (DNN), have shown promise in making sense of this data at a large scale. Also, the research community has worked to reduce the computational and resource demands of DNN to compute on low-resourced micro controllers (MCUs). However, most of the current work in embedded deep learning focuses on solving a single task efficiently, while the multi-tasking nature and applications of IoT devices demand systems that can handle a diverse range of tasks (such as activity, gesture, voice, and context recognition) with input from a variety of sensors, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose YONO, a product quantization (PQ) based approach that compresses multiple heterogeneous models and enables in-memory model execution and model switching for dissimilar multi-task learning on MCUs. We first adopt PQ to learn codebooks that store weights of different models. Also, we propose a novel network optimization and heuristics to maximize the com-pression rate and minimize the accuracy loss. Then, we develop an online component of YONO for efficient model execution and switching between multiple tasks on an MCU at run time without relying on an external storage device. YONO shows remarkable performance as it can compress multiple heterogeneous models with negligible or no loss of accuracy up to 12.37x. Furthermore, YONO's online component enables an efficient execution (latency of 16–159 ms and energy consumption of 3.8-37.9 mJ per operation) and reduces modelloading/switching la-tency and energy consumption by 93.3-94.5% and 93.9-95.0%, respectively, compared to external storage access. Interestingly, YONO can compress various architectures trained with datasets that were not shown during YONO's offline codebook learning phase showing the generalizability of our method. To summarize, YONO shows great potential and opens further doors to enable multi-task learning systems on extremely resource-constrained devices.},

  volume={},

  pages={298-309},
  abstract={End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis suf-fer from kidney failure, with the inability to remove excess fluid causing fluid overload. This can cause many morbidities, and is one of the most insidious and common risk factors for mortality in ESKD patients. Existing solutions for fluid intake monitoring such as self-report and weight gain monitoring are burdensome, non-continuous, and usually administered in clinics only. It is then critical to develop a ubiquitous fluid intake monitoring system to help ESKD patients better control their fluid consumption. In this study, we propose to leverage smartwatch sensor data (e.g., Photoplethysmography (PPG), Gyroscope, etc.) combined with a temporal sensor relation graph neural network (TSR-GNN) to predict fluid intake given past sensing data between two dialysis sessions. Our empirical experiments highlight promising findings about the feasibility of using ubiquitous sensing to predict fluid intake, and demonstrate that the proposed model TSR-GNN outperforms the selected baseline models in both accuracy and robustness. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of model interpretability by attention weights and GNNExplainer variant is conducted to better under-stand the inter-sensor interactions and sensor contributions to the fluid intake prediction results.},

  pages={310-322},
  abstract={Backscatter tag based sensing has received a lot of attention recently due to the battery-free, low-cost and widespread use of backscatter tags, e.g., RFIDs. Despite that, they suffer from an ex-tensive, costly, and time-consuming redesign effort when there are changes in application requirements, such as changes in sensing targets or working frequency bands. This paper introduces a reconfigurable sensing framework, which enables us to easily reconfigure the design parameters of chipless backscatter tags for sensing different targets or working with differ-ent frequency bands, without the need of onerous design effort. To realize this vision, we capture the relationship between the application requirements and the sensing tag's design parameters. This relationship enables us to fast and efficiently reconfigure/change an existing sensing tag design for meeting new application requirements. Real-world experiments show that, by using our reconfig-urable framework to flexibly redesign a tag's parameters, the sensing tag achieves more than 92.1 % accuracy for sensing four different applications and working on four different frequency bands.},

  title={An Energy Supervisor Architecture for Energy-Harvesting Applications}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={323-336},
  abstract={Energy-harvesting designs typically include highly entangled app-lication-level and energy-management subsystems that span both hardware and software. This tight integration makes developing sophisticated energy-harvesting systems challenging, as developers have to consider both embedded system development and intermit-tent energy management simultaneously. Even when successful, solutions are often monolithic, produce suboptimal performance, and require substantial effort to translate to a new design. Instead, we propose a new energy-harvesting power management architecture, Altair that offloads all energy-management operations to the power supply itself while making the power supply programmable. Altair introduces an energy supervisor and a standard interface to enable an abstraction layer between the power supply hardware and the running application, making both replaceable and recon-figurable. To ensure minimal resource conflict on the application processor, while running resource-hungry optimization techniques in the supervisor, we implement the Altair design in a lower power microcontroller that runs in parallel with the application. We also develop a programmable power supply module and a software library for seamless application development with Altair. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture across a spectrum of IoT devices and demonstrate the generality of the plat-form. We also design and implement an online energy-management technique using reinforcement learning on top of the platform and compare the performance against fixed duty-cycle baselines. Results indicate that sensors running the online energy-manager perform similar to continuously powered sensors, have a l0x higher event generation rate than the intermittently powered ones, 1.8-7x higher event detection accuracy, experience 50% fewer power failures, and are 44% more available than the sensors that maintain a constant duty-cycle.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={337-349},
  abstract={Sensor networks gather data at one or more gateway devices by sequentially receiving data frames from individual sensor nodes. In cases where applications rely on data that is distributed across sev-eral nodes, the latency of such node-by-node data collection scales with the number of nodes and the frame sizes involved, impeding fast decision-making. This paper seeks to overcome that limitation for latency-sensitive classification problems by introducing One-Take, a cross-layer aggregation protocol that aims to decouple the process of data gathering from network size and frame length. The protocol leverages dominance properties between concurrently transmitted symbols to convey socalled collages, messages that de-scribe relationships between data held by several nodes, rather than local information from any single node. Collages thus transmit a hash of distributed data that is computed within the physical layer, thereby communicating more informative features than regular frames of the same length. Experiments on a recent wireless mesh network platform, called Zero-wire, demonstrate that two-byte collages are delivered correctly 99% of the time and, using public sensor network data sets, show that One-take achieves a latency reduction of circa 42% relative to node-by-node transmissions.},

  volume={},

  pages={350-362},
  abstract={Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) is a popular link-layer pro-tocol defined in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard that improves the reli-ability and throughput of wireless sensor networks by exploiting diversity in both time and frequency. Despite the body of literature proposing several scheduling schemes for TSCH, a gap yet to be filled is the design of an effective way to deal with internal and external interference, which are both known to strongly affect communication performance. In fact, existing works either make use of a fixed schedule (and hence cannot cope with interference), or re-quire extra control traffic (and hence increase energy consumption). In this paper, we present SmarTiSCH, an interference-aware en-gine for IEEE 802.15.4e-based networks that retains the simplicity and energy-efficiency of autonomous scheduling, while increasing the awareness as well as robustness to both internal and external interference. With SmarTiSCH, the nodes in the network infer the presence of interference and react to it without the need of extra control traffic. Specifically, SmarTiSCH enables each node to infer the interference by passively observing existing data exchanges. It then lets a pair of nodes exchange information and mutually agree on a proper strategy to mitigate interference without the need of extra transmissions. We implement SmarTiSCH in Contiki-NG and evaluate its performance on a testbed of 20 off-the-shelf IEEE 802.15.4 devices based on the nRF52840. Our results show that SmarTiSCH increases the reliability of transmissions by up to 2.9 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the presence of interference, while even lowering the duty cycle by 54.3%.},

  abstract={This paper presents EMU, a framework that enables the emulation, snipping, and multiplexing of LoRa chirps on commercial IoT devices equipped with low-power sub-GHz transceivers, including those supporting LoRa itself. Chirp snipping consists in artificially removing a sequence of chips and in putting the radio in low-power mode, which allows to reduce energy consumption while still commu-nicating reliably. Chirp multiplexing exploits the gaps introduced by chirp snipping to transmit portions of another chirp on a sep-arate channel, which allows to concurrently transmit two LoRa packets and to increase the throughput. We build EMU as a modu-lar framework and implement support for off-the-shelf LoRa and non-LoRa transceivers. We then evaluate its performance by com-paring the reliability, efficiency, and receiver sensitivity achieved by EMU with that of traditional LoRa for different physical layer settings. We finally showcase EMU's ability to send packets over two channels simultaneously, thereby improving the uplink throughput of LoRaWan, and demonstrate that even non-LoRa transceivers employing EMU can communicate to a LoRaWan gateway, enabling new use cases and expanding the applicability of LoRa technology.},

  number={},
  pages={377-389},
  abstract={We present radio-frequency (RF) information harvesting, a chan-nel sensing technique that takes advantage of the energy in the wireless medium to detect channel activity at essentially no en-ergy cost. RF information harvesting is essential for event-driven wireless sensing applications using battery-less devices that har-vest tiny amounts of energy from impromptu events, such as op-erating a switch, and then transmit the event notification to a one-hop gateway. As multiple such devices may concurrently de-tect events, coordinating access to the channel is key. RF infor-mation harvesting allows devices to break the symmetry between concurrently-transmitting devices based on the harvested energy from the ongoing transmissions. To demonstrate the benefits of RF information harvesting, we integrate it in a tailor-made ultra low-power hardware MAC protocol we call Radio Frequency-Distance Packet Queuing (RF-DiPaQ). We build a hardware/software proto-type of RF-DiPaQ and use an established Markov framework to study its performance at scale. Comparing RF-DiPaQ against sta-ple contention-based MAC protocols, we show that it outperforms pure Aloha and 1-CSMA by factors of 3.55 and 1.21 respectively in throughput, while it saturates at more than double the offered load compared to 1-CSMA. As traffic increases, the energy saving of RF-DiPaQ against CSMA protocols increases, consuming 36% less energy than np-CSMA at typical offered loads.},

This paper presents MiLTOn, a novel acoustic and mm-wave based solution for through-box non-invasive product integrity sensing that is sensitive to even minute sub-mm cracks in the object. MiLTOn is inspired by acoustic vibrometry used for instance to monitor cracks in railroads. Unlike traditional vibrometry, MiL-TOn is unique in its ability to sense products non-invasively using an external transducer and microphone, neither of which are in direct physical contact of the object within the box. MiLTOn pro-cesses measurements from the microphone to design a robust and environment-independent product signature that can be used to sense presence of product defects. Our extensive evaluation on a large number of fragile products of diverse materials demonstrates 97% accuracy in identifying product damage.},

  pages={403-414},
  abstract={Measuring rotation speed is essential to many engineering applications; it elicits faults undetectable by vibration monitoring alone and enhances the vibration signal analysis of rotating machines. Optical, magnetic or mechanical Tachometers are currently state-of-art. Their limitations are they require line-of-sight, direct access to the rotating object. This paper proposes RFTacho, a rotation speed measurement system that leverages novel hardware and signal processing algorithms to produce highly accurate readings con-veniently. RFTacho uses RF Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) waves to measure rotation speed of multiple machines simultane-ously with no requirements from the machine's properties. OAM antennas allow it to operate in high-scattering environments, com-monly found in industries, as they are resilient to de-polarization compared to linearly polarized antennas. RFTacho achieves this by using two novel signal processing algorithms to extract the rotation speed of several rotating objects simultaneously amidst noise arising from high-scattering environments, non-line-of-sight scenarios and dynamic environmental conditions with a resolution of 1rpm. We test RFTacho on several real-world machines like fans, motors, air conditioners. Results show that RFTacho has avg. error of < 0.5% compared to ground truth. We demonstrate RFTacho's simultaneous multiple-object measurement capability that other tachometers do not have. Initial experiments show that RFTacho can measure speeds as high as 7000 rpm (theoretically 60000 rpm) with high resiliency at different coverage distances and orientation angles, requiring only 150 mW transmit power while operating in the 5 GHz license-exempt band. RFTacho is the first RF-based sensing system that combines OAM waves and novel processing approaches to measure the rotation speed of multiple machines simultaneously in a non-intrusive way.},

  abstract={As the number of IoT devices has increased rapidly, IoT botnets have exploited the vulnerabilities of IoT devices. However, it is still challenging to detect the initial intrusion on IoT devices prior to massive attacks. Recent studies have utilized power side-channel in-formation to identify this intrusion behavior on IoT devices but still lack accurate models in real-time for ubiquitous botnet detection. We propose the first online intrusion detection system called DeepAuditor for multiple IoT devices via power auditing. To de-velop the real-time system, we propose a lightweight power auditing device called Power Auditor. We also design a distributed CNN classifier for online inference in a laboratory setting. In order to protect data leakage and reduce networking redundancy, we then propose a privacy-preserved inference protocol via Packed Homo-morphic Encryption and a sliding window protocol in our system. The classification accuracy and processing time are measured, and the proposed classifier outperforms a baseline classifier, especially against unseen patterns. We also demonstrate that the distributed CNN design is secure against any distributed components. Over-all, the measurements are shown to the feasibility of our real-time distributed system for intrusion detection on IoT devices.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={428-440},
  abstract={Current collaborative augmented reality (AR) systems establish a common localization coordinate frame among users by exchanging and comparing maps comprised of feature points. However, relative positioning through map sharing struggles in dynamic or feature-sparse environments. It also requires that users exchange identical regions of the map, which may not be possible if they are separated by walls or facing different directions. In this paper, we present Cappella11Like its musical inspiration, Cappella utilizes collaboration among agents to forgo the need for instrumentation, an infrastructure-free 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) positioning system for multi-user AR applications that uses motion estimates and range measurements between users to establish an accurate relative coordinate system. Cappella uses visual-inertial odometry (VIO) in conjunction with ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging radios to estimate the relative position of each device in an ad hoc manner. The system leverages a collaborative particle filtering formulation that operates on sporadic messages exchanged between nearby users. Unlike visual landmark sharing approaches, this allows for collaborative AR sessions even if users do not share the same field of view, or if the environment is too dynamic for feature matching to be reliable. We show that not only is it possible to perform collaborative positioning without infrastructure or global coordinates, but that our approach provides nearly the same level of accuracy as fixed infrastructure approaches for AR teaming applications. Cappella consists of an open source UWB firmware and reference mobile phone application that can display the location of team members in real time using mobile AR. We evaluate Cappella across mul-tiple buildings under a wide variety of conditions, including a contiguous 30,000 square foot region spanning multiple floors, and find that it achieves median geometric error in 3D of less than 1 meter.},

  abstract={Wireless sensor networks and mobile crowdsensing are two important paradigms in urban dynamic sensing. In both sensing paradigms, task allocation is a significant problem that may affect the completion quality of sensing tasks. In this paper, we focus on allocating sensing tasks for mobile crowdsensing. We propose a system model to illustrate how the allocation mechanism works in crowdsensing and define the task allocation problem as maximum profit routing for mobile crowdsensing (MPRMC). The NP-hardness of MPRMC is proved based on a special case analysis. To solve MPRMC, we consider the problem in two special cases: Temporal-MPRMC and Spatial-MPRMC. Correspondingly, we propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for Temporal-MPRMC and a 2Ɣ-approximation for Spatial-MPRMC, respectively. Then, we generalize the special cases and give a 2Ɣ lg2 n-approximation for MPRMC. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms have the best approximation ratios for MPRMC. Finally, we conduct various experiments to validate the effectiveness of our designs.},

  abstract={Technology innovation has provided the opportunity to study the characteristics of natural human mobility. In this paper, we look at how to identify interesting clusters (by different individuals or other naturally defined groups) in a family of trajectory traces. We focus on coarse-grained, sparsely sampled trajectories inferred from sporadic occurrences in an unsupervised setting. This is a challenging setting due to difficulties in selecting features and similarity measures, and due to lack of prior knowledge of data distribution. We propose a non-parametric clustering algorithm, which makes little assumptions on prior knowledge of both data distribution and cluster properties. Our algorithm, Conformal DBSCAN, combines density-based DBSCAN clustering with the statistical conformal prediction framework. We first identify groups of highly similar trajectories as the initial seeds of clusters, similar to DBSCAN. Then we include additional trajectories that belong to this cluster, with a guaranteed statistical confidence level, derived by an improved conformal prediction framework. This allows the clustering algorithm to automatically adapt to different data distributions. Our algorithms are shown to significantly outperform alternative clustering algorithms on several artificial and real-world datasets.},

  title={The Case for Approximate Intermittent Computing}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={463-476},
  abstract={We present the concept of approximate intermittent computing and concretely demonstrate its application. Intermittent computations stem from the erratic energy patterns caused by energy harvesting: computations unpredictably terminate whenever energy is insufficient and the application state is lost. Existing solutions maintain equivalence to continuous executions by creating persistent state on non-volatile memory, enabling stateful computations to cross power failures. The performance penalty is massive: system throughput reduces while energy consumption increases. In contrast, approxi-mate intermittent computations trade the accuracy of the results for sparing the entire overhead to maintain equivalence to a continuous execution. This is possible as we use approximation to limit the extent of stateful computations to the single power cycle, enabling the system to completely shift the energy budget for managing persistent state to useful computations towards an immediate ap-proximate result. To this end, we effectively reverse the regular formulation of approximate computing problems. First, we apply approximate intermittent computing to human activity recognition. We design an anytime variation of support vector machines able to improve the accuracy of the classification as energy is available. We build a hw/sw prototype using kinetic energy and show a 7x improvement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art system support for intermittent computing, while retaining 83% accuracy in a setting where the best attainable accuracy is 88%. Next, we apply approximate intermittent computing in a sharply different scenario, that is, embedded image processing, using loop perforation. Using a different hw / sw prototype we build and diverse energy traces, we show a 5x improvement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art system support for intermittent computing, while providing an equivalent output in 84% of the cases.},

  pages={477-490},
  abstract={Dependability is an essential part of software engineering in the industry, which is the reason why most companies hire professional quality assurance (QA) engineers. Despite the presence of separate QA engineers, however, software developers are still required to perform basic QA processes by themselves before submitting their new software for peer review. When it comes to mobile system software, however, the basic QA process requires significant time and effort for writing different test scripts for various types of mobile devices, which degrades the productivity of developers. In this paper, we propose ScriptPainter, an easy-to-use automatic test script generator that enables a mobile phone to self-convert vision information on its screen into a test program; developers simply record a video while drawing a test scenario on a mobile touchscreen and ScriptPainter detects and tracks cursor locations in the video for generating a proper script. For accurate cursor detection and tracking with modest computation, ScriptPainter com-prises a set of techniques, such as frame sampling, deep neural network (DNN)-based detection, hough transform-based tracking with bounding box adaptation. ScriptPainter is evaluated on multiple Android smartphones, which shows that it analyzes a video 3.8x faster than pure DNN-based detection. Experiments with human developers show that ScriptPainter speeds up their job 8.3 times while providing even better accuracy compared to manual scripting.},

  abstract={Wireless sensors form an integral part of the Internet of Things (IoT), standing at the edge between the cyber and physical domains. Ac-quiring and transmitting environmental data is an energy-intensive workload, especially when considering networks spanning large buildings or even cities. Many works aim to integrate energy har-vesting into wireless sensors, providing them with a greater level of energy autonomy. Initially deployed for energy-rich outdoor environments, recent advances have allowed wireless sensors to efficiently utilize the reduced energy harvested in indoor lighting conditions. This demo introduces a harvesting-based Dual Proces-sor Platform, the DPP3e, designed for energy harvesting in indoor environments. It features various sensors for advanced indoor en-vironmental sensing, e.g. air quality measurements, a low-power display for immediate visual feedback, and a powerful micro controller for energy-efficient inference of Tensorflow models. Fur-thermore, it has two separate RF interfaces: a 2.4 GHz Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio for short-range communication, and a sub-GHz transceiver for long-range communication. Using configurable power domains and advanced power management, it can sustain sending BLE packets every 5 seconds while consuming only 37 µ W.},

  abstract={Resource-optimized deep neural networks (DNNs) nowadays run on microcontrollers to perform a wide variety of audio, image and sensor data classification tasks. Despite comprehensive support for deep learning tools for 32-bit microcontrollers, performing deep learning inferences on 16-bit microcontrollers still remains a chal-lenge. Although there are some tools for implementing neural net-works on 16-bit systems, generally, there is a large gap in efficiency between the development tools for 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit (or higher) systems. There is also a steep learning curve that discourages beginners inexperienced with microcontrollers and programming in C to develop efficient and effective deep learning models for 16-bit microcontrollers. To fill this gap, we have created a neural network model generator that (1) automatically transfers parameters of a pre-trained DNN or CNN model from commonly used frameworks to a 16-bit microcontroller, and (2) automatically implements the model on the microcontroller to perform on-device inference. The optimization of data transfer saves time and mini-mizes chances of error, and the automatic implementation reduces the complexity to implement DNNs and CNNs on ultra-low-power microcontrollers.},

A key challenge is to learn feature representations from multimodal sensor data to combine the information of different sensors. Although progress has been made by previous works, the correlation between different sensors is still not well exploited, which may limit the performance of representation learning. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning approach to learn representations from multimodal sensor data with maximally correlated autoencoders (MCA). It can efficiently capture high dependence between different modalities at different feature levels. The learned representations are further used for the recognition task.

  abstract={Ultra-wideband technology is applied for indoor positioning systems and achieves a position accuracy in the order of decimeters. A trending approach in this context relies on combined angle-of-arrival and time-of-flight measurements, and enables localization using a single anchor, thereby reducing infrastructure overhead. Although analytical models already exist for Ultra-wideband-based distance estimation using time-of-flight, no model has been proposed for its angle-of-arrival counterpart. In this paper we cover this gap by investigating the use of 4 different machine learning regressors to generate such models. The models were trained with data from real-world experiments performed with commercial off-the-shelf Ultra-wideband modules. The models can be easily integrated in simulators, facilitating and even enabling the evaluation of scalable positioning systems using this technology. Among the tested regressors, the random forest regressor presented the best fit to the experimental data, with MAE of the “mean” parameter of 8°.},

  abstract={Sensor Networks (SNs) are comprised of low-cost nodes deployed in an ad-hoc fashion over a large area and thus are susceptible to various security attacks. Overall SN's security metrics are often modeled by stochastic or Bayesian Attack Graphs which assume certain likelihoods of feasible attacks paths. This paper discusses a next step, security risk attribution to individual SN's components/vulnerabilities, which is an integral part of efficient risk miti-gation. The challenges are due to highly non-linear contribution of individual vulnerabilities to the overall system security risk and as-tronomically large number of mitigation scenarios in real systems. Motivated by (a) uniqueness of Shapley-value based attribution having some desirable properties, and (b) successful application of this attribution in various settings including financial risk attribution, we propose a Shapley value-based security risk attribution to individual SN's components/vulnerabilities.},

  abstract={Traditionally, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) send device-specific over-the-air (OTA) packages to ensure the latest firmware, security patches, etc. With millions of IoT devices, even a tiny per-centage of OTA failures will result in tens of thousands of globally affected consumers. The state-of-the-art OTA methods are suited for high-end Android & embedded Linux devices and not for resource-constrained devices (e.g. MCUs, small CPUs) with only a few MB memory. Current OTA methods have been tested only on non-ML use-cases such as remote bugs patching or security flaws, etc. In this paper, we present OTA-TinyML approach that, via HTTPS, loads the C source file of ML models from a webserver into IoT boards. OTA-TinyML does not strain hardware (resource-friendly) as its implementation spans only a few lines of code. It is compatible with a range of ML models (e.g. text, speech, image domains) and MCUs (e.g. Cortex M series, STM32, Xtensa). OTA-TinyML is tested by performing remote fetching of 6 types of ML models, storing them on 4 types of memory units, then loading and executing on 7 popular Arduino IoT boards.},

  abstract={Hybrid time-of-flight and phase-difference-of-arrival ultra-wideband-based localization systems enable indoor position estimation of mo-bile nodes at a low infrastructure overhead. A known drawback in such systems is the decreasing localization accuracy over distance from node(s) with known location. In this paper we evaluated 3 ML algorithms: Random Forest Regression, LightGBM Regression, and Linear Regression to mitigate this issue. We evaluate the ben-efit of using those methods on experimental data obtained with commercial off-the-shelf transceivers. Our results show that the Random Forest Regression outperforms a typical linear regression correction by 0.49±0.01 (mean±std) meters in positioning accuracy at an computing overhead of nearly 0.34±0.003 [s].},

  abstract={Faults in industrial equipment lead to significant costs due to down-time and unplanned maintenance interventions. Acoustic Internet of Things (IoT) sensors combined with machine learning offers the possibility of early fault detection to mitigate these costs. How-ever, prior approaches to Acoustic Anomaly Detection (AAD) are poorly suited to operating within the resource constraints of IoT systems as they require the acquisition of large volumes of data to train models from scratch for different machine types or oper-ating environments. To overcome the limitations, we introduce a system utilizing pretrained low-dimensional features and Gaussian mixture models. Preliminary results on real-world datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions based on the area under the curve (AUC) score with an average of 4 different machine types. Furthermore, our approach requires far less training data, making it more suitable to operate within the power and network constraints of IoT devices.},

  abstract={Invariable of the agriculture type (precision, smart, or digital), the monitoring process of factors that increase the crop yield and growth is mostly non-ML, manually structured approaches with practical pain points. In this scenario, to reduce monitoring costs and maintenance efforts, there is a requirement for low-cost semi-autonomous distributed systems that can remotely collect plant data and perform standalone ML-based analytics without depending on cloud servers or the internet. In this work, we provide an embedded ML pipeline, which users can use/follow for end-to-end solution design and implementation for any of their use-cases. To demonstrate the pipeline, we use it to collect image data, train a CNN-based regression algorithm, perform hardware-specific tuning, generate optimized code, and deploy binaries on Sony Spresense setup. The initial testing shows that even the resource-constrained MCU-based Spresense, in real-time (992 ms), high performance (96.2% accuracy, 1.86 cm2 RMSE), could analyze a plant in a semi-autonomous environment to predict the leaf area and plant growth.},

  abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) large amounts of data can be gathered at the edge, centrally collected and subsequently utilized for various application domains. Efficient and reliable synchro-nous communication protocols are essential for automated data gathering, yet they typically require a stable energy supply. En-ergy harvesting enables long-term deployments, but it imposes widely varying energy budgets on each node in the network. To re-main efficient, synchronous protocols need to consider this energy variability. We propose a selective flooding protocol that employs low-energy communication rounds for all nodes and additional high-energy rounds only for nodes with high input power thus increasing their throughput. Low-energy rounds gather data with high reliability and maintain global network synchronization, while high-energy rounds use increased transmit power to overcome potentially-broken links that depend on low-power nodes. We eval-uate our proposed method on the FlockLab testbed and build a small network composed of standalone energy harvesting nodes. The average power consumption of almost 84 µW and 177 µW for low- and high-power nodes, respectively, are fully sustainable by indoor photovoltaic harvesting.},

However, in line with other contemporary works, we propose a novel use of them in the data plane by leveraging their natural property: different bit positions suffer from different degrees of errors. The idea is to map different components of web pages to different bit positions (based on their priority). We evaluate our approach for web page transmission over a wireless link that traditionally uses TCP and demonstrate benefits for image and video-based web pages. For an image-based web page, there is a 47.96% to 81.12% gain in performance, while the received image quality score varies between 0.97 and 0.99. We observe up to a 63.56% gain in performance for web pages with embedded videos with only a 7.45% loss in the received video quality.},

We propose an IoT-based irrigation system, which includes two major components, i.e., an IoT wireless network of sensing and actuation nodes, and a DRL-based control algorithm. Given the collected soil moisture data and weather data, the DRL-based algorithm finds an optimal irrigation schedule, which uses the minimum amount of water to guarantee the soil-water content above the required level before the next irrigation cycle. We deploy the system in our testbed composed of six almond trees. Through a 12-day in-field experiment, we find that our proposed system can save up to 7.8% of water over a widely-used irrigation scheme.},

  abstract={The trend of Internet of Things is bringing in millions of new smart devices into homes to increase the quality of human life. However, this enormous number of new devices have also brings in an increasing energy consumption in standby for awaiting wire-less communication or status change. To reduce standby energy, existing approaches use real-time consumption data and machine learning techniques to identify standby energy, but aggregate data or intermediate model training updates in the cloud to collaboratively perform load forecasting, which could directly or indirectly cause personal data leakage, alongside with significant communication bandwidth and extra cloud service monetary cost. On the other hand, such a global collaborative model yields unsatisfactory en-ergy management performance as they fail to capture the diversity of each residence. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved, communication-efficient, personalized and cloud-service-free resi-dential energy management system (EMS) with personalized feder-ated deep reinforcement learning (PFDRL) framework to tackle the standby energy reduction in residential building.},

In this setting, the device's lifetime de-pends on the user's activity profile and the resources needed to run inference to classify activities. Thus, the selection of machine learning classification models for energy-positive activity recognition must consider both model's classification accuracy and energy con-sumption compared to the harvested energy from human activities. In this paper, we study the trade-off between accuracy and resource usage of a neural network model when different feature extraction techniques are used. Our results indicate that an on-board sched-uling algorithm can be used to dynamically switch between the optimal feature input tuned for accuracy and energy consumption.},

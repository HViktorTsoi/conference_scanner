abstract = {Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) technology is increasingly being considered for mobile devices and use cases such as vehicular communication. This requires suitable experimentation platforms to support systems-oriented research to tackle the multitude of problems and challenges of mm-wave communications in such environments. To this end, we introduce mm-FLEX, a flexible and modular open platform with real-time signal processing capabilities that supports a bandwidth of 2 GHz and is compatible with mm-wave standard requirements. mm-FLEX integrates an FPGA-based baseband processor with full-duplex capabilities together with mm-wave RF front-ends and phased antenna arrays that are fully configurable from the processor in real-time. To demonstrate the capabilities of mm-FLEX, we implement a scalable, ultra-fast beam alignment mechanism for IEEE 802.11ad systems. It is based on compressive estimation of the signal's angle-of-arrival by means of switching through multiple receive beam patterns on a nano-second time-scale while receiving a packet preamble. Our implementation is open source and is made publicly available to the research community.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of milliMap, a single-chip millimetre wave (mmWave) radar based indoor mapping system targetted towards low-visibility environments to assist in emergency response. A unique feature of milliMap is that it only leverages a low-cost, off-the-shelf mmWave radar, but can reconstruct a dense grid map with accuracy comparable to lidar, as well as providing semantic annotations of objects on the map. milliMap makes two key technical contributions. First, it autonomously overcomes the sparsity and multi-path noise of mmWave signals by combining cross-modal supervision from a co-located lidar during training and the strong geometric priors of indoor spaces. Second, it takes the spectral response of mmWave reflections as features to robustly identify different types of objects e.g. doors, walls etc. Extensive experiments in different indoor environments show that milliMap can achieve a map reconstruction error less than 0.2m and classify key semantics with an accuracy of ~ 90\%, whilst operating through dense smoke.},

abstract = {Tire wear is a leading cause of automobile accidents globally. Beyond safety, tire wear affects performance and is an important metric that decides tire replacement, one of the biggest maintenance expense of the global trucking industry. We believe that it is important to measure and monitor tire wear in all automobiles. Current approach to measure tire wear is manual and extremely tedious. Embedding sensor electronics in tires to measure tire wear is challenging, given the inhospitable temperature, pressure and dynamics of the tire. Further, off-tire sensors placed in the well such as laser range-finders are vulnerable to road debris that may settle in tire grooves.This paper presents Osprey, the first on-automobile, mmWave sensing system that can measure accurate tire wear continuously and is robust to road debris. Osprey's key innovation is to leverage existing, high volume, automobile mmWave RADAR, place it in the tire well of automobiles and observe reflections of the RADAR's signal from the tire surface and grooves to measure tire wear, even in the presence of debris. We achieve this through a super-resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture RADAR algorithm that exploits the natural rotation of the tire and improves range resolution to sub-mm. We show how our system can eliminate debris by attaching specialized metallic structures in the grooves that behave as spatial codes and offer a unique signature, when coupled with the rotation of the tire. In addition to tire wear sensing, we demonstrate the ability to detect and locate unsafe, metallic foreign objects such as nails lodged in the tire.We evaluate Osprey on commercial tires mounted on mechanical, tire-rotation rig and passenger car. We test Osprey at different speeds, in the presence of different types of debris, different levels of debris, on different terrains, and different levels of automobile vibration. We achieve a median absolute tire wear error of 0.68 mm across all our experiments. Osprey also locates foreign objects lodged in the tire with an error of 1.7 cm and detects metallic foreign objects with an accuracy of 92\%.},

abstract = {Recently proposed OFDMA backscatter could improve both concurrency and spectrum allocation flexibility for backscatter systems based on OFDM. However, we find that it is remarkably inefficient for the existing design to scale up in prototyping: it requires one-by-one offline computation to obtain tags' operating parameters, in order to ensure orthogonality among subcarriers in the system; moreover, the tag hardware has to be dedicatedly modified offline before being assigned multiple subcarriers. The inefficiency is caused by the current analog frequency synthesis design for the tag. This paper proposes DigiScatter, an OFDMA backscatter system realizing digital frequency synthesis, which provides an efficient prototyping approach for large-scale OFDMA backscatter networks. In DigiScatter, we for the first time integrate IDFT into the tag design; such a simple but effective improvement enables the system to support high concurrency and flexible spectrum resource allocation through pure software configurations in an online manner. We build a prototype and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our design. DigiScatter physically realizes 100 and 300 concurrent OFDMA backscatter transmissions in 2.4GHz and 900MHz respectively, and provides frequency synthesis capability for supporting 1019 concurrent transmissions.},

abstract = {This paper presents GateScatter, the first backscatter-based gateway connecting commodity IoT to WiFi. The backscatter design of GateScatter is an economic option towards pervasive Internet connectivity for ever-growing IoT. The carefully designed tag optimally reshapes ZigBee IoT packets with an arbitrary payload into an 802.11b WiFi packet over the air, such that the payload can be reliably retrieved at the WiFi receiver (hence a gateway). Gate-Scatter is highly compatible - it works with a wide range of IEEE 802.15.4-compliant systems, is agnostic to upper layer proprietary protocols, and does not require any modification to the commodity IoT platforms. GateScatter is extended to BLE IoT for generality. We prototype GateScatter hardware on FPGA where the wide applicability is demonstrated through evaluations on five popular IoT devices including Samsung SmartThings sensor, Philips smart bulb, and Amazon Echo Plus. Further extensive evaluations show that GateScatter consistently achieves throughput above 200 kbps and range of over 27 m under diverse practical scenarios including a corridor, dormitory room, and under user mobility.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication, in which data is conveyed through reflecting excitation signals, has been advocated as a promising green technology for Internet of Things (IoT). Existing backscatter solutions however are mostly centralized, relying on a single excitation source, typically within one hop. Though recent works have demonstrated the viability of multi-hop backscatter, the excitation signal remains centralized, which attenuates quickly and fundamentally limits the communication scope. For long-range and high-quality communication, distributed excitations are expected and also naturally available as ambient signals (WiFi, BLE, cellular, FM, light, sound, etc.), albeit not being explored for boosting nearby tags for relaying.Given the existence of distributed excitation, a relay tag has to be decodable, i.e., be able to first decode its previous hop's information and then backscatter to the next hop with a boost from a nearby excitation whenever possible. In this paper, we present DecRel, a decodable tag relay solution towards a backscatter sensor mesh for universal and scalable deployment with distributed excitation. DecRel is also an innovative wireless sensor architecture for simultaneous sensing and relay. It incorporates a relay path that uses envelope detection for decoding, and a sensing path that converts its own sensor data into a baseband for amplitude-demodulation by the next hop tag's relay path. The two paths then backscatter their respective data to different frequencies to avoid interference. We have built a working DecRel tag prototype using FPGA, discrete components, and off-the-shelf analog devices. Our experiments show superior performance of DecRel as compared with the state-of-the-art non-decodable tag relay: specifically, a digital baseband's multi-hop throughput of up to 40Kbps (200x improvement), an analog baseband's equivalent multi-hop throughput of up to 768Kbps (3000x improvement), and a tag-to-tag distance of up to 4.8m (10x improvement) with a hop count of up to 6. DecRel tag consumes 337.9μW of power using IC design.},

abstract = {The growth rate of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices sold globally is constantly lower than the forecast. This deceleration is caused in part by the need for batteries and the scalability cost for their replacement. Backscatter has attracted significant interest over the past couple of years to enable sustainable sensing devices by eliminating batteries. IoT devices have been designed for transmitting sensed data with backscatter, but the question of efficient reception of data with battery-free devices is still open. As shown in this paper, classical low-power Radio Frequency (RF) envelope detectors are affected by low sensitivity, false detection alarms, and low energy efficiency. We argue that Light Fidelity (LiFi) can provide downlink and harvesting medium as LED lights are becoming pervasively deployed for illumination. We show, for the first time, that the advantages of LiFi and RF backscatter can be combined for battery-free communication. We design a low-power platform that leverages the complementary nature of these two mediums. We demonstrate that our platform removes energy-inefficiency in the downlink reception typical of RF backscatter, and significantly expands the deployment scenarios for battery-free tags when compared to conventional single-technology designs.},

abstract = {In recent years, considerable effort has been recently exerted to explore the high-precision RF-tracking systems indoors to satisfy various real-world demands. However, such systems are tailored for a particular type of device (e.g., RFID, WSN or Wi-Fi). With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), various new wireless protocols (e.g., LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT) have been proposed to accommodate different demands. The coexistence of multiple types of IoT devices forces users to deploy multiple tracking systems in a warehouse or a smart home where various IoT devices are running, which causes huge additional costs in installation and maintenance. To address this issue, this work presents iArk, which is a general-purpose tracking platform for all types of IoT devices working at the ultra high frequency band. Our innovation lies in the design of the "K+1"-model hardware, the protocol free middleware, and the multipath resistant learnware. By the virtue of decoupling from wireless protocols, iArk also allows researchers to concentrate on developing a new tracking algorithm without considering the protocol diversity. To date, the platform can support five mainstream types of IoT devices (i.e., NB-IoT, LoRa, RFID, Sigfox and Zigbee) and is scalable to other types with minimal effort.},

Recently, the ARM architecture has come into the spotlight of cache side-channel attacks with its unprecedented growth in the market.We propose SmokeBomb, a novel cache side-channel mitigation that functions by explicitly ensuring a private space for each process to safely access sensitive data. The heart of the idea is to use the L1 cache of the CPU core as a private space by which SmokeBomb can give consistent results against cache attacks on the sensitive data, and thus, an attacker cannot distinguish specific data used by the victim. Our experimental results show that SmokeBomb can effectively prevent currently formalized cache attack methods.},

abstract = {The advent of smart devices has caused unprecedented security and privacy concerns to its users. Although the fingerprint technology is a go-to biometric solution in high-impact applications (e.g., smart-phone security, monetary transactions and international-border verification), the existing fingerprint scanners are vulnerable to spoofing attacks via fake-finger and cannot be employed across smart devices (e.g., wearables) due to hardware constraints. We propose SonicPrint that extends fingerprint identification beyond smartphones to any smart device without the need for traditional fingerprint scanners. SonicPrint builds on the fingerprint-induced sonic effect (FiSe) caused by a user swiping his fingertip on smart devices and the resulting property, i.e., different users' fingerprint would result in distinct FiSe. As the first exploratory study, extensive experiments verify the above property with 31 participants over four different swipe actions on five different types of smart devices with even partial fingerprints. SonicPrint achieves up to a 98\% identification accuracy on smartphone and an equal-error-rate (EER) less than 3\% for smartwatch and headphones. We also examine and demonstrate the resilience of SonicPrint against fingerprint phantoms and replay attacks. A key advantage of SonicPrint is that it leverages the already existing microphones in smart devices, requiring no hardware modifications. Compared with other biometrics including physiological patterns and passive sensing, SonicPrint is a low-cost, privacy-oriented and secure approach to identify users across smart devices of unique form-factors.},

abstract = {Higher privileged trust anchors such as thin hypervisors and Trust-Zone have been adopted to protect mobile OSs. For instance, the Samsung Knox security platform implements a kernel integrity monitor based on a hardware-assisted virtualization technique for 64-bit devices. Although it protects the OS kernel integrity, the monitoring platform itself can be a target of attackers if it encompasses exploitable bugs. In this paper, we propose SelMon, a portable way of self-protecting kernel integrity monitors without introducing another higher privileged trust anchor. To this end, we first logically separate the regions of the integrity monitor into two parts: privileged and non-privileged regions. Then, we ensure that only the privileged region code can access the critical data objects that can be exploited to compromise the monitor integrity (e.g., the hypervisor page table). The non-critical operations in terms of preserving the monitor integrity are conducted in the non-privileged region. In addition to the privilege separation, we also illustrate how to utilize the general hardware features, watchpoint and data execution prevention (DEP), to ensure the robustness of the separation. In the evaluation, it was found that our approach imposes a negligible overhead of 2\% in the worst case with SPEC CPU2006.},

In this paper, we present MagHacker, a new sensing system that realizes such eavesdropping attack over commodity mobile devices, which monitor and analyze the magnetic field being produced by the stylus pen's internal magnet. MagHacker divides the continuous magnetometer readings into small segments that represent individual letters, and then translates these readings into writing trajectories for letter recognition. Experiment results over realistic handwritings from multiple human beings demonstrate that MagHacker can accurately eavesdrop more than 80\% of handwriting with stylus pens, from a distance of 10cm. Only slight degradation in such accuracy is produced when the eavesdropping distance or the handwriting speed increases. MagHacker is highly energy efficient, and can well adapt to different stylus pen models and environmental contexts.},

Increasingly, edge devices (smartphones and consumer IoT devices) are equipped with pre-trained DNNs for a variety of applications. This trend comes with privacy risks as models can leak information about their training data through effective membership inference attacks (MIAs).We evaluate the performance of DarkneTZ, including CPU execution time, memory usage, and accurate power consumption, using two small and six large image classification models. Due to the limited memory of the edge device's TEE, we partition model layers into more sensitive layers (to be executed inside the device TEE), and a set of layers to be executed in the untrusted part of the operating system. Our results show that even if a single layer is hidden, we can provide reliable model privacy and defend against state of the art MIAs, with only 3\% performance overhead. When fully utilizing the TEE, DarkneTZ provides model protections with up to 10\% overhead.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Neural Weight Virtualization - which enables fast and scalable in-memory multitask deep learning on memory-constrained embedded systems. The goal of neural weight virtualization is two-fold: (1) packing multiple DNNs into a fixed-sized main memory whose combined memory requirement is larger than the main memory, and (2) enabling fast in-memory execution of the DNNs. To this end, we propose a two-phase approach: (1) virtualization of weight parameters for fine-grained parameter sharing at the level of weights that scales up to multiple heterogeneous DNNs of arbitrary network architectures, and (2) in-memory data structure and run-time execution framework for in-memory execution and context-switching of DNN tasks. We implement two multitask learning systems: (1) an embedded GPU-based mobile robot, and (2) a microcontroller-based IoT device. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed algorithms as well as the two systems that involve ten state-of-the-art DNNs. Our evaluation shows that weight virtualization improves memory efficiency, execution time, and energy efficiency of the multitask learning systems by 4.1x, 36.9x, and 4.2x, respectively.},

abstract = {Elf is a runtime for an energy-constrained camera to continuously summarize video scenes as approximate object counts. Elf's novelty centers on planning the camera's count actions under energy constraint. (1) Elf explores the rich action space spanned by the number of sample image frames and the choice of per-frame object counters; it unifies errors from both sources into one single bounded error. (2) To decide count actions at run time, Elf employs a learning-based planner, jointly optimizing for past and future videos without delaying result materialization. Tested with more than 1,000 hours of videos and under realistic energy constraints, Elf continuously generates object counts within only 11\% of the true counts on average. Alongside the counts, Elf presents narrow errors shown to be bounded and up to 3.4X smaller than competitive baselines. At a higher level, Elf makes a case for advancing the geographic frontier of video analytics.},

abstract = {Many users have reported that their smartphones shut off unexpectedly, even when they show >30\% remaining battery capacity. After examining the problem from both the user and phone sides, we discovered the cause of these unexpected shutoffs to be a large and dynamic internal voltage drop of the phone battery, which is, in turn, caused by the dynamics of both battery's internal resistance and the phone's discharge current. To fix these unexpected shutoffs, we design a novel Battery-aware Power Management (BPM) middleware that accounts for these dual-dynamics in phone operation. Specifically, BPM profiles the battery's internal resistance --- which varies with battery state-of-charge (SoC), temperature, and aging --- using a novel duty-cycled charging method. BPM then regulates, at run-time, the phone's discharge current based on the constructed battery profile. We have implemented and evaluated BPM on 4 commodity smartphones from different OEMs with the latest battery firmware, demonstrating that BPM prevents unexpected phone shutoffs and extends their operation time by 1.16--2.03X. Our user study, which includes 121 mobile phone users, also corroborates BPM's usefulness/attractiveness.},

abstract = {A legal contract is an agreement between two or more parties as to something that is to be done in the future. Forming contracts electronically is desirable since it is convenient. However, existing electronic contract platforms have a critical shortcoming. They do not provide strong evidence that a contract has been legally and validly created. More specifically, they do not provide strong evidence that an electronic signature is authentic, that there was mutual assent, and that the parties had an opportunity to read the contract. We present Tabellion, a system for forming legal contracts on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, that addresses the above shortcoming. We define four secure primitives and use them in Tabellion to introduce self-evident contracts, the validity of which can be verified by independent inspectors. We show how these primitives can be implemented securely in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of mobile devices as well as a secure enclave in a centralized server, all with a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to build a fully functional contract platform on top of these primitives. We develop ~15,000 lines of code (LoC) for our prototype, only ~1,000 of which need to be trusted. Through analysis, prototype measurements, and a 30-person user study, we show that Tabellion is secure, achieves acceptable performance, and provides slightly better usability than the state-of-the-art electronic contract platform, DocuSign, for viewing and signing contracts.},

abstract = {LoRa, a representative Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, has been shown as a promising platform to connect Internet of Things. Practical LoRa deployments, however, suffer from collisions, especially in dense networks and wide coverage areas expected by LoRa applications. Existing collision resolution approaches do not exploit the coding properties of LoRa and thus cannot work well for low SNR LoRa signals. We propose NScale to decompose concurrent transmissions by leveraging subtle inter-packet time offsets for low SNR LoRa collisions. NScale (1) translates subtle time offsets, which are vulnerable to noise, to robust frequency features, and (2) further amplifies the time offsets by non-stationary signal scaling, i.e., scaling the amplitude of a symbol differently at different positions. In practical implementation, we propose a noise resistant iterative symbol recovery method to combat symbol distortion in low SNR, and address frequency shifts incurred by CFO and packet time offsets in decoding. We theoretically show that NScale introduces < 1.7 dB SNR loss compared with the original LoRa. We implement NScale on USRP N210 and evaluate its performance in both indoor and outdoor networks. NScale is implemented in software at the gateway and can work for COTS LoRa nodes without any modification. The evaluation results show that NScale improves the network throughput by 3.3x for low SNR collided signals compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Conventional wireless communication systems are typically designed assuming a single transmitter-receiver pair for each link. In Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WANs), this one-to-one design paradigm is often overly pessimistic in terms of link budget because client packets are frequently detected by multiple gateways (i.e. one-to-many). Prior work has shown massive improvement in performance when specialized hardware is used to coherently combine signals at the physical layer.In this paper, we explore the potential of using multiple receivers at the MAC and link layer where these performance gains are often neglected. We present an approach called Opportunistic Packet Recovery (OPR) that targets the most likely corrupt bits across a set of packets that suffered failed CRCs at multiple LoRa LP-WAN base-stations. We see that bit errors are often disjoint across receivers, which aids in collaborative error detection. OPR leverages this to provide increasing gain in error recovery as a function of the number of receiving gateways. Since LP-WAN networks can easily offload packet processing to the cloud, there is ample compute time per packet (order of seconds) to search for bit permutations that would restore packet integrity. Link layer corrections have the advantage of being immediately applicable to the millions of already deployed LP-WAN systems without additional hardware or expensive RF front-ends. We experimentally demonstrate that OPR can correct up to 72\% of packets that would normally have failed, when they are captured by multiple gateways.},

abstract = {Smart home Wi-Fi IoT devices are prevalent nowadays and potentially bring significant improvements to daily life. However, they pose an attractive target for adversaries seeking to launch attacks. Since the secure IoT communications are the foundation of secure IoT devices, this study commences by examining the extent to which mainstream security protocols are supported by 40 of the best selling Wi-Fi smart home IoT devices on the Amazon platform. It is shown that 29 of these devices have either no security protocols deployed, or have problematic security protocol implementations. Seemingly, these vulnerabilities can be easily fixed by installing security patches. However, many IoT devices lack the requisite software/hardware resources to do so. To address this problem, the present study proposes a SecWIR (Secure Wi-Fi IoT communication Router) framework designed for implementation on top of the users' existing home Wi-Fi routers to provide IoT devices with a secure IoT communication capability. However, it is way challenging for SecWIR to function effectively on all home Wi-Fi routers since some routers are resource-constrained. Thus, several novel techniques for resolving this implementation issue are additionally proposed. The experimental results show that SecWIR performs well on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi routers at the expense of only a small reduction in the non-IoT data service throughput (less than 8\%), and small increases in the CPU usage (4.5\%~7\%), RAM usage (1.9 MB~2.2 MB), and the IoT device access delay (24 ms~154 ms) while securing 250 IoT devices.},

abstract = {Intelligent irrigation based on measurements of soil moisture levels in every pot in a greenhouse can not only improve plant productivity and quality but also save water. However, existing soil moisture sensors are too expensive to deploy in every pot. We therefore introduce GreenTag, a low-cost RFID-based soil moisture sensing system whose accuracy is comparable to that of an expensive soil moisture sensor. Our key idea is to attach two RFID tags to a plant's container so that changes in soil moisture content are reflected in their Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) metric at the reader. We show that a low-pass filtered DMRT metric is robust to changes both in the RF environment (e.g., from human movement) and in pot locations. In a realistic setting, GreenTag achieves a 90-percentile moisture estimation errors of 5\%, which is comparable to the 4\% errors using expensive soil moisture sensors. Moreover, this accuracy is maintained despite changes in the RF environment and container locations. We also show the effectiveness of GreenTag in a real greenhouse.},

abstract = {Today's smart devices like fitness tracker, smartwatch, etc., often employ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission. Such devices thus become our information portal, e.g., SMS message and notifications are delivered to those devices through BLE. In this study, we present BlueDoor, which can obtain unauthorized information from smart devices via BLE vulnerability. We thoroughly examine the BLE protocol, and leverage its intrinsic properties designed for low-cost embedded and wearable devices to bypass the encryption and authentication in BLE. By mimicking a low capacity device to downgrade the process of encryption key negotiation and authentication, BlueDoor can enforce a new key with the peripheral BLE device and pass the authentication without user participation. As a result, BlueDoor can extract BLE packets as well as read/write stored data on BLE devices. We show that BlueDoor works well on the fundamental design tradeoff of using BLE on diverse embedded and wearable devices, and thus can be generalized to various BLE devices. We implement the BlueDoor design and examine its performance on 15 COTS BLE enabled smart devices, including fitness trackers, smartwatch, smart bulb, etc. The results show that BlueDoor can break the information flow and obtain different types of information (e.g., SMS message, notifications) delivered to BLE devices. In addition to privacy threats, this further means traditional operations such as using SMS for verification in widely adopted authentication, are insecure.},

BeeCluster's core contribution is predictive optimization, in which an inferred model of the future tasks of the application is used to generate an optimized flight and sensing schedule for the drones that aims to minimize the total expected execution time.We built a prototype of BeeCluster and evaluated it on five real-world case studies with drones in outdoor environments, measuring speedups from 11.6\% to 23.9\%.},

In this paper, we explore whether the WiFi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol, with its robust, accurate ranging capability, can complement current GPS and odometry systems to achieve lane-level positioning in urban canyons. We introduce Wi-Go, a system that simultaneously tracks vehicles and maps WiFi access point positions by coherently fusing WiFi FTMs, GPS, and vehicle odometry information together. Wi-Go also adaptively controls the FTM messaging rate from clients to prevent high bandwidth usage and congestion, while maximizing the tracking accuracy. Wi-Go achieves lane-level vehicle positioning (1.3 m median and 2.9 m 90-percentile error), an order of magnitude improvement over vehicle built-in GPS, through vehicle experiments in the urban canyons of Manhattan, New York City, as well as in suburban areas (0.8 m median and 3.2 m 90-percentile error).},

abstract = {Localization in urban environments is becoming increasingly important and used in tools such as ARCore [11], ARKit [27] and others. One popular mechanism to achieve accurate indoor localization as well as a map of the space is using Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Visual-SLAM). However, Visual-SLAM is known to be resource-intensive in memory and processing time. Further, some of the operations grow in complexity over time, making it challenging to run on mobile devices continuously. Edge computing provides additional compute and memory resources to mobile devices to allow offloading of some tasks without the large latencies seen when offloading to the cloud. In this paper, we present Edge-SLAM, a system that uses edge computing resources to offload parts of Visual-SLAM. We use ORB-SLAM2 as a prototypical Visual-SLAM system and modify it to a split architecture between the edge and the mobile device. We keep the tracking computation on the mobile device and move the rest of the computation, i.e., local mapping and loop closure, to the edge. We describe the design choices in this effort and implement them in our prototype. Our results show that our split architecture can allow the functioning of the Visual-SLAM system long-term with limited resources without affecting the accuracy of operation. It also keeps the computation and memory cost on the mobile device constant which would allow for deployment of other end applications that use Visual-SLAM.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of backhaul connectivity for rural and developing regions, which is essential for universal fixed/mobile Internet access. To this end, we propose to exploit the TV white space (TVWS) spectrum for its attractive properties: low cost, abundance in under-served regions and favorable propagation characteristics. Specifically, we propose a system called WhiteHaul for the efficient aggregation of the TVWS spectrum tailored for the backhaul use case. At the core of WhiteHaul are two key innovations: (i) a TVWS conversion substrate that can efficiently handle multiple non-contiguous chunks of TVWS spectrum using multiple low cost 802.11n/ac cards but with a single antenna; (ii) novel use of MPTCP as a link-level tunnel abstraction and its use for efficiently aggregating multiple chunks of the TVWS spectrum via a novel uncoupled, cross-layer congestion control algorithm. Through extensive evaluations using a prototype implementation of WhiteHaul, we show that: (a) WhiteHaul can aggregate almost the whole of TV band with 3 interfaces and achieve nearly 600Mbps TCP throughput; (b) the WhiteHaul MPTCP congestion control algorithm provides an order of magnitude improvement over state of the art algorithms for typical TVWS backhaul links. We also present additional measurement and simulation based results to evaluate other aspects of the WhiteHaul design.},

abstract = {Given the availability of lightweight radio and processing technology, it becomes feasible to imagine spectrum sensing systems using weather balloons. Such balloons navigate the airspace up to 40 km, and can provide a bird's eye and clear view of terrestrial, as well as aerial spectrum use. In this paper, we present SkySense, which is an extension of the Electrosense sensing framework with mobile GPS-located sensors and local data logging. In addition, we present 6 different sensing campaigns, targeting multiple terrestrial or aerial technologies such as ADS-B, AIS or LTE. For instance, for ADS-B, we can clearly conclude that the number of airplanes that are detected is the same for each balloon altitude, but the message reception rate decreases strongly with altitude because of collisions. For each sensing campaign, the dataset is described, and some example spectrum analysis results are presented. In addition, we analyse and quantify important trends visible when sensing from the sky, such as temperature and hardware variations, increased ambient interference levels, as well as hardware limitations of the lightweight system. A key challenge is the automatic gain control and dynamic range of the system, as a radio navigating over 30km, sees a very wide range of possible signal levels. All data is publicly available through the Electrosense framework, to encourage the spectrum sensing community to further analyse the data or motivate further measurement campaigns using weather balloons.},

We develop a cross-device connection management scheme, a buffering strategy, a packet scheduling algorithm, and a policy framework tailored to MPBond's architecture. We implement MPBond on commodity mobile devices such as Android smartphones and smartwatches. Our real-world evaluations using different workloads under various network conditions demonstrate the efficiency of MPBond.

abstract = {As video calls and personal broadcasting become popular, the demand for mobile live streaming over cellular uplink channels is growing fast. However, current live streaming solutions are known to suffer from frequent uplink throughput fluctuations causing unnecessary video stalls and quality drops. As a remedy to this problem, we propose PERCEIVE, a deep learning-based uplink throughput prediction framework. PERCEIVE exploits a 2-stage LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) design and makes throughput predictions for the next 100ms. Our extensive evaluations show that PERCEIVE, trained with LTE network traces from three major operators in the U.S., achieves high accuracy in the uplink throughput prediction with only 7.67\% mean absolute error and outperforms existing prediction techniques. We integrate PERCEIVE with WebRTC, a popular video streaming platform from Google, as a rate adaptation module. Our implementation on the Android phone demonstrates that it can improve PSNR by up to 6dB (4x) over the default WebRTC while providing less streaming latency.},

abstract = {As we look to use Wear OS (formerly known as Android Wear) devices for fitness and health monitoring, it is important to evaluate the reliability of its ecosystem. The goal of this paper is to understand the reliability weak spots in Wear OS ecosystem. We develop a state-aware fuzzing tool, Vulcan, without any elevated privileges, to uncover these weak spots by fuzzing Wear OS apps. We evaluate the outcomes due to these weak spots by fuzzing 100 popular apps downloaded from Google Play Store. The outcomes include causing specific apps to crash, causing the running app to become unresponsive, and causing the device to reboot. We finally propose a proof-of-concept mitigation solution to address the system reboot issue.},

abstract = {Microsleep, caused by sleep deprivation, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy, costs the U.S.'s economy more than $411 billion/year because of work performance reduction, injuries, and traffic accidents. Mitigating microsleep's consequences require an unobtrusive, reliable, and socially acceptable microsleep detection solution throughout the day, every day. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not meet these requirements.In this paper, we propose a novel behind-the-ear wearable device for microsleep detection, called WAKE. WAKE detects microsleep by monitoring biosignals from the brain, eye movements, facial muscle contractions, and sweat gland activities from behind the user's ears. In particular, we introduce a Three-fold Cascaded Amplifying (3CA) technique to tame the motion artifacts and environmental noises for capturing high fidelity signals. The behind-the-ear form factor is motivated by the fact that bone-conductance headphones, which are worn around the ear, are becoming widely used. This technology trend gives us an opportunity to enable a wide range of cognitive monitoring and improvement applications by integrating more sensing and actuating functionality into the ear-phone, making it a smarter one.Through our prototyping, we show that WAKE can suppress motion and environmental noise in real-time by 9.74-19.47 dB while walking, driving, or staying in different environments ensuring that the biosignals are captured reliably. We evaluated WAKE against gold-standard devices on 19 sleep-deprived and narcoleptic subjects. The Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation results show the feasibility of WAKE in microsleep detection on an unseen subject with average precision and recall of 76\% and 85\%, respectively.},

abstract = {Over 50 million people undergo surgeries each year in the United States, with over 70\% of them filling opioid prescriptions within one week of the surgery. Due to the highly addictive nature of these opiates, a post-surgical window is a crucial time for pain management to ensure accurate prescription of opioids. Drug prescription nowadays relies primarily on self-reported pain levels to determine the frequency and dosage of pain drug. Patient pain self-reports are, however, influenced by subjective pain tolerance, memories of past painful episodes, current context, and the patient's integrity in reporting their pain level. Therefore, objective measures of pain are needed to better inform pain management.This paper explores a wearable system, named Painometry, which objectively quantifies users' pain perception based-on multiple physiological signals and facial expressions of pain. We propose a sensing technique, called sweep impedance profiling (SIP), to capture the movement of the facial muscle corrugator supercilii, one of the important physiological expressions of pain. We deploy SIP together with other biosignals, including electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) for pain quantification.From the anatomical and physiological correlations of pain with these signals, we designed Painometry, a multimodality sensing system, which can accurately quantify different levels of pain safely. We prototyped Painometry by building a custom hardware, firmware, and associated software. Our evaluations use the prototype on 23 subjects, which corresponds to 8832 data points from 276 minutes of an IRB-approved experimental pain-inducing protocol. Using leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate performance on unseen data shows 89.5\% and 76.7\% accuracy of quantification under 3 and 4 pain states, respectively.},

abstract = {Approximately 7 million survivors of stroke reside in the United States. Over half of these individuals will have residual deficits, making stroke one of the leading causes of disability. Long-term rehabilitation opportunities are critical for millions of individuals with chronic upper limb motor deicits due to stroke. Traditional in-home rehabilitation is reported to be dull, boring, and un-engaging. Moreover, existing rehabilitation technologies are not user-friendly and cannot be adaptable to different and ever-changing demands from individual stroke survivors. In this work, we present RehabPhone, a highly-usable software-defined stroke rehabilitation paradigm using the smartphone and 3D printing technologies. This software-definition has twofold. First, RehabPhone leverages the cost-effective 3D printing technology to augment ordinal smartphones into customized rehabilitation tools. The size, weight, and shape of rehabilitation tools are software-defined according to individual rehabilitation needs and goals. Second, RehabPhone integrates 13 functional rehabilitation activities co-designed with stroke professionals into a smartphone APP. The software utilizes built-in smartphone sensors to analyzes rehabilitation activities and provides real-time feedback to coach and engage stroke users. We perform the in-lab usability optimization with the RehabPhone prototype with involving 16 healthy adults and 4 stroke survivors. After that, we conduct a 6-week unattended intervention study in 12 homes of stroke residence. In the course of the clinical study, over 32,000 samples of physical rehabilitation activities are collected and evaluated. Results indicate that stroke users with RehabPhone demonstrate a high adherence and clinical efficacy in a self-managed home-based rehabilitation course. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory clinical study using mobile health technologies in real-world stroke rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Real-time user emotion recognition is highly desirable for many applications on eyewear devices like smart glasses. However, it is very challenging to enable this capability on such devices due to tightly constrained image contents (only eye-area images available from the on-device eye-tracking camera) and computing resources of the embedded system. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel system called EMO that can recognize, on top of a resource-limited eyewear device, real-time emotions of the user who wears it. Unlike most existing solutions that require whole-face images to recognize emotions, EMO only utilizes the single-eye-area images captured by the eye-tracking camera of the eyewear. To achieve this, we design a customized deep-learning network to effectively extract emotional features from input single-eye images and a personalized feature classifier to accurately identify a user's emotions. EMO also exploits the temporal locality and feature similarity among consecutive video frames of the eye-tracking camera to further reduce the recognition latency and system resource usage. We implement EMO on two hardware platforms and conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations. Our results demonstrate that EMO can continuously recognize seven-type emotions at 12.8 frames per second with a mean accuracy of 72.2\%, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approach, and consume much fewer system resources.},

To fill this gap and support future research in this area, we introduce BenchERoid, a set of 34 Android apps with injected event-race bugs. The current version of benchmark contains 36 types of event-race bugs that were identified by analyzing Android concurrency literature and publicly available issue repositories. We believe that our framework is a valuable resource for both developers and researchers interested in concurrency bug analysis in Android.

abstract = {Joint angle analysis facilitates research into injury prevention, rehabilitation, and activity monitoring. Sensors used in such analysis must be unobtrusive, accurate, and if used for motion, capable of monitoring fast-paced, dynamic motions. To effectively contribute to these applications, we created a body-mounted electromagnet-based sensing system for joint angle analysis called Magneto. Our system is wireless, features a high sampling rate, is not subject to drift, and is unaffected by outside magnetic noise. Magnetic field readings are influenced by noise due to magnetic interference from the Earth's magnetic field, the environment, and nearby ferrous objects. Magneto uses the combination of an electromagnet and magnetometer to remove environmental interference from a magnetic field reading. We evaluated this sensing method to show its performance when removing the interference in three-movement dimensions, in six environments, and with six different cycling rates. Then, we localized the electromagnet with respect to the magnetic field reader in any direction within a 13.8 cm range with a relative error of 2.3\% for the distance and an average error of 3.43° for the orientation angle. We applied Magneto in a pilot study: calculating elbow flexion angles. In this study, we calculated elbow flexion angles to the nearest 15° with 93.8\% accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper builds a Near-field Communication (NFC) based localization system that allows ordinary surfaces to locate surrounding objects with high accuracy in the near-field. While there is rich prior work on device-free localization using far-field wireless technologies, the near-field is less explored. Prior work in this space operates at extremely small ranges (a few centimeters), leading to designs that sense close proximity rather than location.We propose TextileSense, a near-field beamforming system which can track everyday objects made of conductive materials (e.g., a human hand) even if they are a few tens of centimeters away. We use multiple flexible NFC coil antennas embedded in ordinary and irregularly shaped surfaces we interact with in smart environments - furniture, carpets, etc. We design and fabricate specialized textile coils woven into the fabric of the furniture and easily hidden by acrylic paint. We then develop a near-field blind beamforming algorithm to efficiently detect surrounding objects, and use a data-driven approach to further infer their location. A detailed experimental evaluation of TextileSense shows an average accuracy of 3.5 cm in tracking the location of objects of interest within a few tens of centimeters from the furniture.},

abstract = {Run-time domain shifts from training-phase domains are common in sensing systems designed with deep learning. The shifts can be caused by sensor characteristic variations and/or discrepancies between the design-phase model and the actual model of the sensed physical process. To address these issues, existing transfer learning techniques require substantial target-domain data and thus incur high post-deployment overhead. This paper proposes to exploit the first principle governing the domain shift to reduce the demand on target-domain data. Specifically, our proposed approach called PhyAug uses the first principle fitted with few labeled or unlabeled source/target-domain data pairs to transform the existing source-domain training data into augmented data for updating the deep neural networks. In two case studies of keyword spotting and DeepSpeech2-based automatic speech recognition, with 5-second unlabeled data collected from the target microphones, PhyAug recovers the recognition accuracy losses due to microphone characteristic variations by 37\% to 72\%. In a case study of seismic source localization with TDoA fingerprints, by exploiting the first principle of signal propagation in uneven media, PhyAug only requires 3\% to 8\% of labeled TDoA measurements required by the vanilla fingerprinting approach in achieving the same localization accuracy.},

abstract = {Physical layer key generation has attracted considerable attention in the past decade since it provides an alternative solution for the key establishment in wireless networks using channel reciprocity. In this paper we explore the possibility of physical layer key generation for emerging Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) such as LoRa (Long Range). However, due to the lower transmission rates of LPWANs compared to Wi-Fi and Zigbee, the channel reciprocity is relatively low, which makes timely key generation challenging. To address this problem, we propose a novel information-theoretic key generation scheme that can operate at all data rate settings, featuring a model-based key generation method. Furthermore, we derive an optimal window size to calculate the parameters of the channel model based on a random waypoint model to balance the channel reciprocity and entropy. Extensive evaluations on a campus testbed show that our method can achieve up to 13.8 bps key generation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method improves key generation rate by 3x to 5x. We also analyzed the security of the proposed approach and demonstrated it to be resilient to eavesdropping attacks.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been increasingly deployed in smart homes and smart buildings to monitor and control their environments. The Internet traffic data produced by these IoT devices are collected by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and IoT device manufacturers, and often shared with third-parties to maintain and enhance user services. Unfortunately, extensive recent research has shown that on-path adversaries can infer and fingerprint users' sensitive privacy information such as occupancy and user in-home activities by analyzing IoT network traffic traces. Most recent approaches that aim at defending against these malicious IoT traffic analytics can not sufficiently protect user privacy with reasonable traffic overhead. In particular, many approaches did not consider practical limitations, e.g., network bandwidth, maximum package injection rate or actual user in-home behavior in their design.To address this problem, we design a new low-cost, open-source user "tunable" defense system---PrivacyGuard that enables users to significantly reduce the private information leaked through IoT device network traffic data, while still permitting sophisticated data analytics or control that is necessary in smart home management. In essence, our approach employs intelligent deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs)-based IoT device traffic signature learning, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based artificial traffic signature injection, and partial traffic reshaping to obfuscate private information that can be observed in IoT device traffic traces. We evaluate PrivacyGuard using IoT network traffic traces of 31 IoT devices from 5 smart homes. We find that PrivacyGuard can effectively prevent a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning-based and deep learning-based occupancy and other 9 user in-home activity detection attacks. We release the source code and datasets of PrivacyGuard to IoT research community.},

abstract = {Recently, mmWave has been widely used in fine-grained sensing applications due to its short wavelength and large bandwidth. One mmWave device usually can measure the target's 1D micro-displacement along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction. In this work, we try to empower mmWave with the capability of measuring 2D micro-displacements. Our insight is that although the mmWave reflection from one path contains only 1D observation, the spatial separability of mmWave offers an opportunity to separate multipath reflections from the received signal. Combining the coherent observations from multipath reflections can restore the 2D orbit of the target. Based on this insight, we present GWaltz, a mmWave sensing system that manages to measure sub-mm-level 2D orbits of rotating machinery. In GWaltz, we first reveal the relationship between the rotor's movement and the observed ghost multipath reflections (GMRs) and then design a set of novel signal processing techniques to restore the rotor orbit from the poor-quality GMR signals. We implement GWaltz with a commercial mmWave radar, and our evaluation results show that it achieves an absolute error of about 8.42um when measuring 100um-diameter rotor orbits.},

abstract = {Context-based authentication is a method for transparently validating another device's legitimacy to join a network based on location. Devices can pair with one another by continuously harvesting environmental noise to generate a random key with no user involvement. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the theoretical limitations of environmental noise harvesting, making it difficult for researchers to build efficient algorithms for sampling environmental noise and distilling keys from that noise. This work explores the information-theoretic capacity of context-based authentication mechanisms to generate random bit strings from environmental noise sources with known properties. Using only mild assumptions about the source process's characteristics, we demonstrate that commonly-used bit extraction algorithms extract only about 10\% of the available randomness from a source noise process. We present an efficient algorithm to improve the quality of keys generated by context-based methods and evaluate it on real key extraction hardware. MOONSHINE is a randomness distiller which is more efficient at extracting bits from an environmental entropy source than existing methods. Our techniques nearly double the quality of keys as measured by the NIST test suite, producing keys that can be used in real-world authentication scenarios.},

abstract = {Secure Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is becoming increasingly important with the ever-growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in our daily life. To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic signal based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys. InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works, InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3 times, extends pairing distance by 3.2 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by 2.5 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern smartphones and resource-limited IoT devices. Results show that it is energy-efficient and can run on both powerful and resource-limited IoT devices without incurring excessive resource consumption.},

abstract = {Text input systems based on device-free finger tracking technologies have attracted considerable attention in the use scenarios of mobile and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Issues pertaining to 2D tracking have prompted interest in using 1D finger trajectories for the recognition of handwritten letters. Nonetheless, 1D tracking imposes two major challenges: (i) Trajectory information loss from 2D to 1D; and (ii) Inter-user diversity in writing traits. These challenges could possibly be overcome by collecting a large training dataset for every user; however, this would impose an unacceptable burden on users. This paper presents a text input system with multi-language support without training using acoustic-based 1D finger tracking technology. We developed a novel data augmentation scheme, in which the handwritten image dataset MNISTs are used to create artificial datasets (called TrackMNISTs). We compensate for the trajectory information loss of 1D by creating personal dataset (from TrackMNIST) to match the writing habits of individual users. The proposed data augmentation mechanism is also applicable to multilingual letter recognition. In experiments, MagicInput achieved outstanding classification accuracy on unseen users: 10 digits (98.3\%), 26 uppercase/lowercase English letters (97.8\%/95.3\%), 49 Japanese characters (91.4\%), and the 30 commonly used Chinese characters (93.8\%).},

abstract = {The emergence of radio frequency (RF) dependent device-free indoor occupancy detection has seen slow acceptance due to its high fragility. Experimentation shows that an RF-dependent occupancy detector initially performs well in the room to be sensed. However, once the physical arrangement of objects changes in the room, the performance of the classifier degrades significantly. To address this issue, we propose BLECS, a Bluetooth-dependent indoor occupancy detection system which can adapt itself in the dynamic environment. BLECS uses a reinforcement learning approach to predict the occupancy of an indoor environment and updates its decision policy by interacting with existing IoT devices and sensors in the room. We tested this system in five different rooms for 520 hours in total, involving four occupants. Results show that, BLECS achieves 21.4\% performance improvement in a dynamic environment compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithm with an average F1 score of 86.52\%. This system can also predict occupancy with a maximum 89.23\% F1 score in a completely unknown environment with no initial trained model.},

abstract = {LoRa is a popular Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LP-WAN) technology that allows devices powered by a ten year AA battery to connect to radio infrastructure miles away. One of the most promising features of LoRa is the ability to track the location of radios from a distance, enabling applications ranging from inventory tracking, smart infrastructure monitoring and structural health sensing. Yet, state-of-the-art LoRa localization systems experience errors of several tens or even hundreds of meters in location tracking, owing to the narrow bandwidth and limited battery life of LoRa devices.This paper presents OwLL, a LoRa localization system that limits location error to few meters with commodity LoRa clients in a wide-area network. Our key innovation is the development of a distributed base station network made of individually low-cost components that together span a wide bandwidth that encompasses the TV whitespaces and offers high aperture, crucial to localization accuracy. We demonstrate how this network can aggregate signal measurements made across multiple different narrowband channels of a LoRa client to triangulate it at fine accuracy. We implement and evaluate OwLL on a testbed spanning a large university campus centered in a major U.S. city and demonstrate a 9 m (across line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight) median error in localization.},

Working in the same place opens a new opportunity for these devices to communicate directly with each other, leveraging on Cross-technology Communication (CTC). However, since these devices operate in the same frequency band which results in the competition against each other for network resources, severe interfere may arise. In this paper, we explore pseudo-random sequence (PR sequence) to design a novel CTC protocol that enables low-cost direct communication between WiFi and ZigBee in noisy indoor environments. Pseudorandom sequence offers a unique statistical feature to accomplish both information transmission and synchronization between heterogeneous devices. We design a dynamic synchronous decoding strategy to handle interference coexisted among different wireless protocols. Our system does not require any modification of communication protocol and underlying hardware and firmware. We implement our system on commercial devices (Intel 5300 WiFi NIC and MicaZ CC2420), and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the system performance in three typical scenarios. The experimental results show that the synchronization time of our approach is lower than 0.5 ms, and the accuracy is greater than 84\% while the channel occupancy is as high as 50\%.},

abstract = {The accuracy of an audio classifier drops when it is trained and tested in different conditions aka domains, e.g., different devices, different environments, or their combinations. Previous works have proposed audio domain adaptation techniques for a special case where the training data are recorded with a single source microphone and the model is applied to test data recorded with a different but single target microphone (i.e., single source to single target domain adaptation). In this paper, we solve a more generic and practical problem where the goal is to adapt models that are trained on data from more than one acoustic (i.e., multi-source domain adaptation). Unlike previous works, the proposed method does not assume availability of recording metadata (i.e., domain labels) in the training data---which makes the adaptation problem harder. To solve this, we propose the first multi-task deep neural network architecture to cluster audio samples according to their domain in an unsupervised way. Using the inferred domain information, we perform domain adaptation to remove biases due to domain heterogeneity from the machine learning model. We conduct extensive experiments on an empirical dataset that we collect from five domains as well as on a public dataset. Our results show that the proposed technique has a mean accuracy of 87\% for domain discovery in a five domain scenario and its model adaptation step improves acoustic event classification accuracy by up to 21\% when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on datasets containing samples from multiple source domains.},

abstract = {We introduce Deep Functional Network (DFN) that approximates a black-box Deep Neural Network (DNN) to a functional program consisting of a set of well-known functions and data flows among them. A DFN not only provides a semantic interpretation of a DNN but also enables easy deployment and optimization of the translated program according to the requirements and constraints of the target intelligent sensing system. To interpret a DNN, we propose the DFN framework consisting of two steps: 1) function estimation that estimates the distribution of functions likely to be used in the source DNN and 2) network formation that finds a functional network in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) given the estimated function distribution. Our empirical study conducted with 16 state-of-the-art DNNs demonstrates that the generated DFNs provide semantic understandings of the DNNs along with comparable classification accuracy to the source DNNs. We implement two intelligent sensing systems that use the proposed DFN: 1) a mobile robot that avoids obstacles detected by a camera and 2) a smartphone-based human activity recognizer using IMU sensors, where different sizes of DFNs are generated to complete the task under various resource budgets, i.e., execution time and energy consumption dynamically imposed by run-time scenarios. The experiment result demonstrates that a set of DFNs generated from a single DNN enable both systems to achieve the desired performance under various resource constraints based on semantic understanding of the DNNs.},

abstract = {Vehicle accidents are one of the greatest cause of death and injury in urban areas for pedestrians, workers, and police alike. In this work, we present CSafe, a low power audio-wearable platform that detects, localizes, and provides alerts about oncoming vehicles to improve construction worker safety. Construction worker safety is a much more challenging problem than general urban or pedestrian safety in that the sound of construction tools can be up to orders of magnitude greater than that of vehicles, making vehicle detection and localization exceptionally difficult. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel sound source separation algorithm, called Probabilistic Template Matching (PTM), as well as a novel noise filtering architecture to remove loud construction noises from our observed signals. We show that our architecture can improve vehicle detection by up to 12\% over other state-of-art source separation algorithms. We integrate PTM and our noise filtering architecture into CSafe and show through a series of real-world experiments that CSafe can achieve up to an 82\% vehicle detection rate and a 6.90° mean localization error in acoustically noisy construction site scenarios, which is 16\% higher and almost 30° lower than the state-of-art audio wearable safety works.},

abstract = {Immersive face-to-virtual-face telecommunication is one unique use case for virtual reality (VR) technologies. Existing camera-based telephony systems cannot be used for such immersive VR video chat, due to the physical occlusions of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and/or unwieldy positioning of cameras. To address these, we present ExGSense, a new VR input modality that can sense and reconstruct both upper and lower facial gestures, by only using lightweight biopotential sensors embedded within the HMDs. We optimize the sensor arrangement based on facial anatomy and employ a multiview classification pipeline to exploit the multiple dimensions of signal features. We thus enable ExGSense to detect whole facial gestures by using a sparse set of biopotential transducers. We prototyped ExGSense and evaluated its performance with 42 facial gestures and across different users. We showed a 93\% accuracy for user-specific evaluation, and 77\% accuracy for user-independent evaluation with low calibration overhead. We believe ExGSense constitutes a promising input modality for immersive VR interactions.},

abstract = {The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values ≥ 83\%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate &lt; 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (≥0.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (\~{a} 2m).},

abstract = {Emerging Industrial Internet-of-Things systems require wireless solutions to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers as part of high data rate feedback-control loops over real-time flows. A key challenge is to provide predictable performance and agility in response to fluctuations in link quality, variable workloads, and topology changes. We propose WARP to address this challenge. WARP uses programs to specify a network's behavior and includes a synthesis procedure to automatically generate such programs from a high-level specification of the system's workload and topology. WARP has three unique features: (1) WARP uses a domain-specific language to specify stateful programs that include conditional statements to control when a flow's packets are transmitted. The execution paths of programs depend on the pattern of packet losses observed at runtime, thereby enabling WARP to readily adapt to packet losses due to short-term variations in link quality. (2) Our synthesis technique uses heuristics to improve network performance by considering multiple packet loss patterns and associated execution paths when determining the transmissions performed by nodes. Furthermore, the generated programs ensure that the likelihood of a flow delivering its packets by its deadline exceeds a user-specified threshold. (3) WARP can adapt to workload and topology changes without explicitly reconstructing a network's program based on the observation that nodes can independently synthesize the same program when they share the same workload and topology information. Simulations show that WARP improves network throughput for data collection, dissemination, and mixed workloads on two realistic topologies. Testbed experiments show that WARP reduces the time to add new flows by 5 times over a state-of-the-art centralized control plane and guarantees the real-time and reliability of all flows.},

abstract = {This work investigates a run-time scheduling system for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The Bluetooth specifications propose control of the anchor point (i.e., start time of each connection event) by changing the WinOffset parameter of the control protocol data unit (PDU), which can be very useful when the master schedules multiple connections simultaneously. Since we had no access to the controller (i.e., which wraps the physical layer and link layer of Bluetooth), we could not figure out how WinOffset works or use it the way we wanted. However, with Zephyr's advent, there is room to modify the controller of BLE, and we can adjust anchor points as we want using WinOffset. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic study of this regime in the research community. We experimentally study how commercial devices actually schedule multiple connections and how this inefficient scheduling degrades BLE's performance. Based on the preliminary study, we propose BLEX that dynamically adjusts anchor points of multiple slaves to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements without violating the Bluetooth specifications or intervening the BLE host (i.e., software-defined higher layer). Through extensive performance evaluation on off-the-shelf BLE chips, we show that BLEX provides stable performance regardless of the traffic requirements of applications and shows significantly reduced QoS failures compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling schemes for BLE.},

abstract = {Many Deep Neural Network (DNN) based applications have been developed and run on mobile devices. Although these advanced DNN models can provide better results, they also suffer from high computational overhead which means long delay and more energy consumption when running on mobile devices. To address these problems, many companies have developed dedicated Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for mobile devices, which can process AI features. Compared to CPU, NPU can run DNN models much faster, but with lower accuracy. To address this issue, we leverage model partition techniques to improve the performance of DNN models on mobile devices with NPU. The challenge is to determine which part of the DNN model should be run on CPU and which part to be run on NPU. Based on the delay and the accuracy requirements of the applications, we study two problems: Max-Accuracy where the goal is to maximize the accuracy under some time constraint, and Min-Time where the goal is to minimize the processing time while ensuring the accuracy is above a certain threshold. To solve these problems, we propose heuristic based algorithms which are simple but only search a small number of layer combinations (i.e., where to run which DNN model layers). To further improve the performance, we propose a Machine Learning based Model Partition (MLMP) algorithm. MLMP searches more layer combinations and considers both accuracy loss and processing time simultaneously. We also address many implementation issues to support model partition techniques on mobile devices with NPU. Experimental results show that MLMP outperforms the heuristic based algorithms and it can significantly improve the accuracy or reduce the processing time based on the application requirements.},

abstract = {Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), defined in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard requires complicated slot scheduling to enjoy its collision-free multihop communication capabilities fully. Recently, several autonomous scheduling algorithms that allocate slots without central control and additional control message exchange have been devised. However, autonomous algorithms are traffic oblivious, assigning the same number of slots regardless of traffic demands. Undifferentiated resource allotment is identified as the root cause that impairs the performance of TSCH networks. To address the issue, we propose A3, an autonomous and adaptive slot allocation scheme that adjusts the number of slots per slotframe according to varying traffic loads. A key component of A3 is receiver-side load estimation in real-time without any explicit control message exchange. A3 can be combined with any autonomous scheduling protocols, such as Orchestra and ALICE. With extensive evaluation on a large public testbed comprising 62 nodes, we verify that A3 significantly enhances autonomous scheduling algorithms' performance. It improves throughput by more than twice, PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) by more than six times, and reduces the latency by ten times.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are becoming ubiquitous and are currently used in many security applications: from personal IoT gadgets to banking and databases. Prominent examples of such architectures are Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). A typical TEE relies on a dynamic Root of Trust (RoT) to provide security services such as code/data confidentiality and integrity, isolated secure software execution, remote attestation, and sensor auditing. Despite their usefulness, there is currently no secure means to determine whether a given security service or task is being performed by the particular RoT within a specific physical device. We refer to this as the Root of Trust Identification (RTI) problem and discuss how it inhibits security for applications such as sensing and actuation.We formalize the RTI problem and argue that security of RTI protocols is especially challenging due to local adversaries, cuckoo adversaries, and the combination thereof. To cope with this problem we propose a simple and effective protocol based on biometrics. Unlike biometric-based user authentication, our approach is not concerned with verifying user identity, and requires neither pre-enrollment nor persistent storage for biometric templates. Instead, it takes advantage of the difficulty of cloning a biometric in realtime to securely identify the RoT of a given physical device, by using the biometric as a challenge. Security of the proposed protocol is analyzed in the combined Local and Cuckoo adversarial model. Also, a prototype implementation is used to demonstrate the protocol's feasibility and practicality. We further propose a Proxy RTI protocol, wherein a previously identified RoT assists a remote verifier in identifying new RoTs.},

abstract = {Automated monitoring of livestock behavior can help farmers economically by detecting changes in animal welfare. Prior approaches use video, which requires light and high storage capability, or motion detection, which has difficulty separating subtle activities. Wearable sensors can address these issues but are vulnerable to destruction by the animals. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first system that uses structural vibration to track animal behavior, and the first system to automatically detect piglet nursing. PigNet uses vibration sensors attached to a pig pen to sense the unique vibration patterns and changes in structural response caused by the animals' movement and position within the pen. Combined with our knowledge of pig behavior, we use this physical knowledge of vibration characteristics to detect pig activities and track piglet growth in a real farm environment. Our system is designed to be robust to the harsh environment, which can create unpredictable noise, as well as physically damage or disconnect sensor nodes. When deployed in a real-world farm environment, our system was able to achieve a daily pen-level status profile of up to 90\% accuracy, which tracks nursing activity, sow lying activity, and changes in piglet growth over the weeks-long pre-weaning period.},

abstract = {The majority of infrastructure is susceptible to, and therefore must constantly combat, corrosion. The monitoring and maintenance of corrosion protection (or the consequences of its unchecked failure) is often one of the leading costs of infrastructure upkeep. Galvanic cathodic protection is a common corrosion control technique that is employed in applications from home appliances to boats to bridges. At its core, however, galvanic cathodic protection is simply an electrochemical cell---that is, a battery. This presents an opportunity to treat this corrosion protection as an in-situ power source that by definition will last as long as the protection system itself. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of these pervasive, "ambient galvanic cells" as potential energy harvesting sources. We then show how to use these cells as a power source for wireless sensing devices that monitor the health of the same corrosion protection system. Our system takes advantage of newly available LPWAN technologies that allow for effortless wide-area coverage. We demonstrate the viability and efficacy of the system on one of the most common galvanic cathodic protection systems, home hot water heaters. We show that this technique can be a powerful new asset for corrosion monitoring and for deploying wireless sensor networks broadly.},

abstract = {Deep learning has permitted unprecedented performance in sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR). However, deep learning models often present high computational overheads, which poses challenges to their implementation on resource-constraint devices such as microcontrollers. Usually, the computational overhead increases with the input size. One way to reduce the input size is by constraining the number of sensor channels. We refer to sensor channel as a specific data modality (e.g. accelerometer) placed on a specific body location (e.g. chest). Identifying and removing irrelevant and redundant sensor channels is feasible via exhaustive search only in cases where few candidates exist. In this paper, we propose a smarter and more efficient way to optimize the sensor channel selection during the training of deep neural networks for HAR. Firstly, we propose a light-weight deep neural network architecture that learns to minimize the use of redundant and irrelevant information in the classification task, while achieving high performance. Secondly, we propose a sensor channel selection algorithm that utilizes the knowledge learned by the neural network to rank the sensor channels by their contribution to the classification task. The neural network is then trimmed by removing the sensor channels with the least contribution from the input and pruning the corresponding weights involved in processing them. The pipeline that consists of the above two steps iterates until the optimal set of sensor channels has been found to balance the trade-off between resource consumption and classification performance. Compared with other selection methods in the literature, experiments on 5 public datasets showed that our proposal achieved significantly higher F1-scores at the same time as utilizing from 76\% to 93\% less memory, with up to 75\% faster inference time and as far as 76\% lower energy consumption.},

However, these approaches are expensive due to the need to affix sensors on each and every equipment and also they lack flexibility of usage due to being battery powered. As a solution for these issues, based on the concept of synthetic sensors introduced by a previous research work, a general purpose sensing approach is discussed by the present study. The system can be placed in a corner of a room and will only be taking a maximum of three sensors into account to detect many events happening across the room making it rather cost-effective. Furthermore, performance of several machine learning (ML) algorithms is analysed by this work. With real time testing of the proposed system, the possibility of applying this approach as a cost-effective solution to be used in the day-to-day work is proven.},

However, such data are usually considered privacy-sensitive, and publicly sharing this data may incur significant privacy concerns. In this work, we seek to protect clinical time-series data against membership inference attacks, while maximally retaining the data utility. We achieve this by adding an imperceptible noise to the raw data. Known as adversarial perturbations, the noise is specially trained to force a deep learning model to make inference mistakes (in our case, mispredicting user identities). Our preliminary results show that our solution can better protect the data from membership inference attacks than the baselines, while succeeding in all the designed data quality checks.},

abstract = {Data collection is a major hurdle faced by the researchers, particularly in the field of wearable computing, as it requires significant amount of time and manual effort. Although wearable devices such as, smartwatches have sophisticated sensing capabilities today and are being popularly used by CPS researchers, collecting data from the sensors embedded on the smartwatch remains a challenging job. The fundamental limitation of the smartwatches is the small form factor, which makes it difficult for the user to input any data collection preferences or labels for the data collection. The existing apps/systems that takes such inputs manually from the user are therefore ineffective for the smartwatches. In this paper, we present the idea of using voice interaction capabilities of a smartwatch for conveniently collecting and labeling sensor data from the available sensing modalities. We present VoiSense, a voice interactive smartwatch based system which intelligently gathers the user preferences and data labels with voice interaction and facilitates convenient data collection without requiring any expertise or significant manual effort.},

abstract = {Distributed computing, computer networking, cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are all around us, yet very little of the underlying concepts are being taught in introductory computer science courses in K12. Teaching IoT is especially problematic since it requires hardware with its own cost and maintenance requirements that many under-resourced schools cannot afford. However, smartphones are commonplace networked devices that boast a wide range of sensors. With the right approach, they can be used to introduce many advanced computing concepts even to novices. We have created a mobile app, PhoneIoT, which makes all available sensors accessible to the user's computer through NetsBlox, a block-based educational programming environment specializing in networking and distributed computing. Accessing PhoneIoT uses the same simple networking primitives as other NetsBlox services, so no additional knowledge is required. PhoneIoT makes it possible to collect sensor data, build a custom graphical interface on the device and receive corresponding events, all without leaving your browser running NetsBlox. This demonstration will showcase a few simple projects such as an exercise tracking app and how to turn your phone into a game controller.},

In this poster, we introduce GT-SF, a distributed TSCH scheduling function that is designed based on the non-cooperative game-theory for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) applications. We implement GT-SF on Zolerita firefly IoT motes and the Contiki-NG operating system to examine its effectiveness.

The receiver employs the typical principle of an envelope detector that harvests RF energy from its antenna, while it employs a nano-power operation amplifier to intensify the obtained signal prior to the final decoding that is realized with the aid of a comparator circuit. It operates at the 868 MHz ISM band using OOK signals propagated through LoRa transceivers, while also supporting addressing capabilities in order to awake only the specified network's nodes. The power expenditure of the developed receiver is as low as 580 nA, remaining at the same power consumption levels as the state-of-the-art implementations.},

Biometrics have been used to detect newcomers, including face, fingerprint, voice, iris, etc. These approaches often require active participation of the users or require dense instrumentation. Prior work using footstep-induced floor vibration to identify people removes these requirements, but only functions for known people due to the high variability in footstep-induced vibrations and the limited number of predicted classes in supervised learning. To overcome the limitations, we introduce a newcomer detection system based on non-parametric Bayesian learning, which models the variability and distribution of consecutive footstep-induced floor vibration for newcomer walking patterns. Preliminary results from real-world experiments with 6 people show up to 92\% accuracy in newcomer detection with an average of 4 consecutive footsteps.},

We proposed a framework where we first stepped into the attacker's shoes to design a correlation-based evasion attack and tested it against four different malware detection models. The attack exploited vulnerabilities and drastically reduced the performance of all four detection models. Later we proposed adversarial retraining as the defense strategy to counter the attacks and improve the adversarial robustness of android malware detection models.},

abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) refers to recognizing a human's ongoing actions through sensor data. At present, one of the main problems faced by Human Activity Recognition is that different subjects, devices and wearing positions can cause inconsistent sensor data distribution. When a classification model trained using some labeled dataset is used to classify a new unlabeled data with different distributions, there will be a significant performance loss. However, it is difficult to annotate manually sensor data for new subjects. Prior works applying unsupervised domain adaptation methods to solve this problem only used a single source domain. However, in practice, it is common to have multiple labeled source domains. Inspired by a work in the field of computer vision, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for human activity recognition using multiple source domains. Experimental results on a commonly used public HAR dataset show that our model can effectively alleviate the performance loss caused by inconsistent distributions. Moreover, compared with the single-source domain adaptation, the multi-source domain adaptation method can improve the accuracy further.},

We use 3D-printed pill bottles equipped with a magnetic switch sensor and an accelerometer. The bottles are carefully designed to minimize power consumption and we devise new machine learning-based techniques that use the accelerometer data generated during bottle interaction (pill extraction) to capture the user gesture that is extracting the pill.

abstract = {The number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge devices has exploded in recent years. Coupled with recent advances in learning methodologies, these can make the vision of smart building a reality and transform how people interact with their environment. Deep learning-driven systems have been already successful in many IoT application areas of pervasive sensing and ubiquitous computing including human activity monitoring and occupancy detection. However, the robustness of such systems at scale is dependent on the availability of a large amount of data labeled by a human expert. Acquiring human annotation involves high effort, high cost, and is often error-prone. Therefore, learning to execute tasks in a machine learning system without manual inspection is of prime interest as it can open up opportunities for continual learning in the long-term deployment of IoT systems. In this work, we propose deep neural network-based approaches for segmentation and classification tasks in sensor streams with no or limited labels. We focus on reducing human labeling efforts in machine learning systems by 1) leveraging temporal features learned through deep neural networks for downstream tasks and 2) learning robust features in dynamic environments by utilizing multiple sensing sources and semi-supervised learning (e.g. small amount of labeled data).},

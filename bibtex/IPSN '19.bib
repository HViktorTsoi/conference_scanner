abstract = {Two nanosatellites recently launched into space had issues with respect to its stabilization, power and orientation. The signals were intermittent, and amateur radio enthusiasts around the globe were requested to observe the satellites so as to get their health information. As decoding the received signals required proprietary hardware (that could not be sent to everyone), amateur radio receivers recorded the signal using Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and sub-sampled the carrier signals to make it easy to share. The captured signals, modulated using binary Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), included noise and more importantly the frequency shifts due to Doppler, caused by the speed of the satellites (of about 7.8 km/s), thus making decoding a major challenge even for the designated proprietary receivers (failed in some cases). As the existing FSK methods did not work effectively, we were motivated by this challenge to design an effective FSK decoder that works in the presence of Doppler and noise. In this paper, we propose Teager Energy Decoder (TED) based on Teager Energy Operator to decode such Doppler and noise influenced sub-sampled data. TED does not need any Doppler correction mechanisms and can dynamically adapt to the changing frequency shifts. We evaluate TED using simulation as well as from the signals from those two satellites. We show that TED performs better than COTS transceivers and available GNU-radio-based solutions using SDRs. TED is low-complexity algorithm, O(N2), and has been prototyped on a low-power micro-controller. TED can be easily adopted on satellites to decode signals for space Internet of Things applications.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) improves the user's experience when interacting with the virtual world, and could revolutionarily transform the designs of many interactive systems. However, providing VR from untethered mobile devices is difficult due to their limited local capabilities. Existing VR solutions address this difficulty by rendering VR frames at remote computing facilities, but are limited to rendering every VR frame separately. A tremendous amount of VR frame data, hence, needs to be transmitted to mobile devices over low-bandwidth wireless links and seriously impairs VR performance. In this paper, we aim to remove this performance constraint on highly dynamic VR applications with complicated scenes and intensive user movement, by adaptively reusing the redundant VR pixels across multiple VR frames. We leverage the unique characteristics of image warping used in current VR applications, and fundamentally expand the scope of image warping to the entire VR lifespan to precisely capture the fluctuations of VR scene due to VR dynamics. We implemented our design over Android OS and Unity VR application engine, and demonstrated that our design can maximize the mobile VR performance over highly dynamic VR scenarios with 95\% less amount of VR frame data being transmitted, by completely removing the pixel redundancy across VR frames.},

abstract = {RFID tracking has attracted significant interest from both academia and industry due to its low cost and ease of deployment. Previous works focus more on tracking in 2D space or separately consider tracking of the location and the orientation. They especially struggle in 3D situations due to the increase in the degree of freedom and the limited information conveyed by the RFID tags. In this paper, we propose 3D-OmniTrack, an approach that can accurately track the 3D location and orientation of an object. We introduce a polarization-sensitive phase model in an RFID system, which takes into consideration both the distance and the 3D posture of an object. Based on this model, we design an algorithm to accurately track the object in 3D space. We conduct real-world experiments and present results that show 3D-OmniTrack can achieve centimeter-level location accuracy with the average orientation error of 5°. 3D-OmniTrack has significant advantages in both the accuracy and the efficiency, compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {In recent years we are experiencing an important growth of interest for sensing the electromagnetic spectrum and making its access more agile. Emerging initiatives use low-cost receivers in large deployments for sensing the radio spectrum or collecting air-traffic signals at large scale. One of the major drawbacks of low-cost spectrum receivers is their limited sampling rate, which does not allow to decode wideband signals. In order to circumvent the hardware limitations of single receivers, we envision a scenario where non-coherent receivers sample the signal collaboratively to cover a larger bandwidth than the one of the single receiver and then, enable the signal reconstruction and decoding in the backend. We present a methodology to enable the signal reconstruction in the backend by multiplexing in frequency a certain number of noncoherent receivers in order to cover a signal bandwidth that would not otherwise be possible using a single receiver. We propose a method that does not use the knowledge of the modulation scheme, and has been designed to be transparent to the subsequent decoding process. As such, it is equivalent to the reception of the signal by a high-end receiver. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with two non-coherent receivers which collaboratively sample an aviation signal of almost twice the bandwidth of each receiver. The experimental results show that, using two non-coherent receivers, our method is able to reconstruct and decode correctly more than 80\% of data.},

abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technique that enables direct communication across different wireless technologies. Recent works achieve physical-level CTC by emulating the standard time-domain waveform of the receiver. This method faces the challenges of inherent unreliability due to the imperfect emulation. Different from analog emulation, we propose a novel concept named digital emulation, which stems from the following insight: The receiver relies on the phase shift to decode symbols rather than the shape of analog time-domain waveform. There are lots of phase sequences which satisfy the requirement of phase shift. The distortions of these phase sequences after WiFi emulation are different. We have the opportunity to select an appropriate phase sequence with the relatively small emulation errors to achieve a reliable CTC. The key point of digital emulation is generic and applicable to a set of CTCs, where the transmitter has a wider bandwidth for emulation and the receiver decoding is based on the phase shift. In this paper, we implement our proposal as WIDE, a physical-level CTC via digital emulation from WiFi to ZigBee. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of WIDE. The results show that WIDE significantly improves the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) from 41.7\% to 86.2\%, which is 2X of WEBee's, an existing representative physical-level CTC.},

abstract = {A large body of work has shown that ultra-wideband (UWB) technology enables accurate indoor localization and tracking thanks to its high time-domain resolution. Existing systems, however, are typically designed to localize only a limited number of tags, and involve the exchange of several messages following a given schedule. As a result, the scalability of current solutions in terms of tag density is limited, as well as their efficiency and responsiveness. In this paper, we present SnapLoc, a UWB-based indoor localization system that allows an unlimited number of tags to self-localize at a theoretical upper bound of 2.3 kHz. In SnapLoc, a tag obtains the responses from multiple anchors simultaneously. Based on these signals, the tag derives the time difference of arrival between anchors and estimates its position. Therefore, SnapLoc does not require tags to actively transmit packets, but to receive only a single message. This allows tags to passively localize themselves and ensures that the performance of SnapLoc does not degrade with high node densities. Moreover, due to the (quasi-)simultaneous responses, a tight clock synchronization between anchors is not needed. We have implemented SnapLoc on a low-cost platform based on the Decawave DW1000 radio and solved limitations in the transceiver's timestamp resolution to sustain a high localization accuracy. An experimental evaluation shows that SnapLoc exhibits a 90\% error and median error of 33 cm and 18 cm, respectively, hence enabling decimeter-level accuracy at fast update rates for countless tags.},

abstract = {In natural hazard warning systems fast decision making is vital to avoid catastrophes. Decision making at the edge of a wireless sensor network promises fast response times but is limited by the availability of energy, data transfer speed, processing and memory constraints. In this work we present a realization of a wireless sensor network for hazard monitoring based on an array of event-triggered single-channel micro-seismic sensors with advanced signal processing and characterization capabilities based on a novel co-detection technique. On the one hand we leverage an ultra-low power, threshold-triggering circuit paired with on-demand digital signal acquisition capable of extracting relevant information exactly and efficiently at times when it matters most and consequentially not wasting precious resources when nothing can be observed. On the other hand we utilize machine-learning-based classification implemented on low-power, off-the-shelf microcontrollers to avoid false positive warnings and to actively identify humans in hazard zones. The sensors' response time and memory requirement is substantially improved by quantizing and pipelining the inference of a convolutional neural network. In this way, convolutional neural networks that would not run unmodified on a memory constrained device can be executed in real-time and at scale on low-power embedded devices. A field study with our system is running on the rockfall scarp of the Matterhorn H\"{o}rnligrat at 3500 m a.s.l. since 08/2018.},

abstract = {Wearable sensors provide enormous opportunities to identify activities and events of interest for various applications. However, a major limitation of the current systems is the fact that machine learning algorithms trained on particular sensors need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as adding a new sensor. In this paper, we aim to seamlessly train machine learning algorithms for the new sensors to identify activities and observations that are detectable by the pre-existing sensors. We create a domain adaptation method to expand training algorithms from known wearable sensors to new sensors, eliminating the need for manual training of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, our proposed approach eliminates the need for capturing substantial amount of data on new sensors. We propose the concept of stochastic features for human activity recognition, and design a new architecture of deep neural network to approximate the posterior distribution of the features. This approximation aligns the feature space of the new and old sensors by using limited, unlabeled data from the new sensor so that the previously defined classifier can be used with the new sensor. The experimental results show that (i) stochastic features are more robust against additive noise compared to typical convolutional neural networks based on deterministic features (ii) our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms. It can also achieve 10\% improvement when training new sensors with limited unlabeled training data compared to training a model from scratch for the new sensor.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Internet of things (IoT), information fusion becomes one of the key technology. Serial fusion plays an important role in information fusion, which concatenates the features obtained from different sources to get a super-feature with higher discrimination. However, the performance of the serial fusion is usually affected by the poor quality of the indistinguishable real-world datasets, especially the problem of noise and imbalance. The existing noise data removal methods may destroy the data distribution, and the existing over-sampling methods may create noise samples. They may affect the result of feature reduction and further reduce the performance of the classification. To address these big practical challenges, a novel Small-Groups-based Serial Fusion method (SGSF) is proposed. SGSF consists of two main parts: a Small-Groups-based Noise Removal method (SGNR) and a small-groups-based Positive Region Oriented Oversampling method (PROO). Both of these two methods are based on the Neighborhood Rough Set (NRS) theory. SGNR identifies and removes low-density noise samples whilst keeps the high-density outlier samples, targeting to enlarge the limited NRS positive region and preserve the data distribution. PROO generates new samples towards the NRS positive region so that it can balance the dataset and increase the number of samples with more explicit features. Intensive experiments are carried out to verify the performance of SGSF based on 3 publicly available datasets and 6 self-collected medical datasets. The results demonstrate that SGSF increases the classification accuracy from existing 82.2\% to 94.3\%.},

This paper presents PreAct, the first energy-management algorithm that exploits time-varying utility to optimize application performance. PreAct's design combines strategic long-term planning of future energy utilization with feedback control to compensate for deviations from the expected conditions. We implement PreAct on a low-power microcontroller and compare it against the state of the art on multiple years of real-world data. Our results demonstrate that PreAct is up to 53 \% more effective in utilizing harvested solar energy and significantly more robust to uncertainties and inefficiencies of practical systems. These gains translate into an improvement of 28\% in the end-to-end performance of a real-world application we investigate when using PreAct.},

abstract = {Although low-power lossy network (LLN), at its early stage, commonly used asynchronous link layer protocols for simple operation on resource-constrained nodes, development of embedded hardware and time synchronization technologies made Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) viable in LLN (now part of IEEE 802.15.4e standard). TSCH has the potential to be a link layer solution for LLN due to its resilience to wireless interference (e.g., WiFi) and multi-path fading. However, its slotted operation incurs non-trivial cell scheduling overhead: two nodes should wake up at a time-frequency cell together to exchange a packet. Efficient cell scheduling in dynamic multihop topology in wireless environments has been an open issue, preventing TSCH's wide adoption in practice. This work introduces ALICE, a novel autonomous link-based cell scheduling scheme which allocates a unique cell for each directional link (a pair of nodes and traffic direction) by closely interacting with the routing layer and using only local information, without any additional communication overhead. We implement ALICE on Contiki and evaluate its effectiveness on the IoT-LAB public testbed with 68 nodes. ALICE generally outperforms Orchestra (the state-of-the-art method) and even more so under heavy traffic and high node density, increasing throughput by 2 times with 98.3\% reliability and reducing latency by 70\%, route changes by 95\%, and radio duty cycle by 35\%. ALICE can serve as an autonomous scheduling framework, which paves the way for TSCH-based LLN to go on.},

abstract = {We propose Chorus, a new ultra-wideband (UWB) localization scheme in which the target device computes the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of signals sent concurrently by localization anchors in known positions. This scheme, similar to GPS, is the opposite of existing TDOA schemes for UWB, where the target transmits the signal and anchors compute the time difference. This reversed perspective enables several advantages in Chorus, including support for countless targets.The cornerstone and novelty of Chorus is the use of concurrent transmissions from anchors; distance information is acquired at the receiver based on the channel impulse response (CIR) resulting from the fused signals. We contribute i) an analytical model enabling a priori estimation of the CIR resulting from the superposition of concurrent signals ii) techniques to accurately extract the time-of-flight information necessary for localization from the measured CIR, and iii) real-world experiments that validate the model as well as assess the practical feasibility and performance of Chorus.Experiments with the DW1000 UWB chip show that Chorus achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy. However, our model shows that performance is limited by idiosyncrasies of the DW1000 that, if removed in next-generation UWB hardware, could unlock an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy.},

abstract = {Many research and industrial communities are betting on LoRa to provide reliable, long-range communication for the Internet of Things. This new radio technology, however, provides widely heterogeneous coverage; a LoRa link may span hundreds of meters or tens of kilometers, depending on the surrounding environment. This high variability is not captured by popular channel models for LoRa, and on-site measurements---a common alternative---are impractical due to the large geographical areas involved.We propose a novel, automated approach to estimate the coverage of LoRa gateways prior to deployment and without on-site measurements. We achieve this goal by combining free, readily-available multispectral images from remote sensing with the right channel model. Our processing toolchain automatically classifies the type of environment (e.g., buildings, trees, or open fields) traversed by a link, with high accuracy (&gt;90\%) and spatial resolution (10X10m2). We use this information to explain the attenuation observed in experiments. As signal attenuation is not well captured by popular channel models, we focus on the Okumura-Hata empirical model, hitherto largely unexplored for LoRa, and show that i) it yields estimates very close to our observations, and ii) we can use our toolchain to automatically select and configure its parameters. A validation on 8,000+ samples from a real dataset shows that our automated approach predicts the expected signal power within a ~10dBm error, against the 20--40dBm of popular channel models.},

abstract = {Dashboard camera installations are becoming increasingly common due to various Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based services provided by them. Though deployed primarily for crash recordings, calibrating these cameras can allow them to measure real-world distances, which can enable a broad spectrum of ADAS applications such as lane-detection, safe driving distance estimation, collision prediction, and collision prevention. Today, dashboard camera calibration is a tedious manual process that requires a trained professional who needs to use a known pattern (e.g., chessboard-like) at a calibrated distance. In this paper, we propose SmartDashCam, a system for automatic and live calibration of dashboard cameras which always ensures highly accurate calibration values. Smart-DashCam leverages collecting images of a large number of vehicles appearing in front of the camera and using their coarse geometric shapes to derive the calibration parameters. In sharp contrast to the manual process we are proposing the use of a large amount of data and machine learning techniques to arrive at calibration accuracies that are comparable to the manual process. SmartDashCam implemented using commodity dashboard cameras estimates real-world distances with mean errors of 5.7\% which closely rivals the 4.1\% mean error obtained from traditional manual calibration using known patterns.},

abstract = {Mobile and embedded devices are increasingly using microphones and audio-based computational models to infer user context. A major challenge in building systems that combine audio models with commodity microphones is to guarantee their accuracy and robustness in the real-world. Besides many environmental dynamics, a primary factor that impacts the robustness of audio models is microphone variability. In this work, we propose Mic2Mic - a machine-learned system component - which resides in the inference pipeline of audio models and at real-time reduces the variability in audio data caused by microphone-specific factors. Two key considerations for the design of Mic2Mic were: a) to decouple the problem of microphone variability from the audio task, and b) put minimal burden on end-users to provide training data. With these in mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to learn Mic2Mic using unlabeled and unpaired data collected from different microphones. Our experiments show that Mic2Mic can recover between 66\% to 89\% of the accuracy lost due to microphone variability for two common audio tasks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in passively tracking multiple people walking in an area, using only the magnitude of WiFi signals from one WiFi transmitter and a small number of receivers (configured as an array) located on one side of the area. Past works on RF-based tracking either track only a single moving person, use a large number of transceivers surrounding the area to track multiple people, or use additional resources like ultra-wideband signals. Furthermore, magnitude-based tracking provides an attractive feature that additional receiver antennas can easily be added to the antenna array as needed, without the need for phase synchronization, since the magnitude can be measured independently on the different antennas. In this paper, we then propose a new framework that uses only the magnitude of WiFi signals and expresses it in terms of the angles of arrival of signal paths at the receivers as well as the motion parameters of the virtual arrays emulated by the moving people. We then use a two-dimensional MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate the aforementioned parameters, and further utilize a Particle Filter with a Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter to track multiple people walking in the area. We extensively validate our proposed framework in both indoor and outdoor areas, through 40 experiments of tracking 1 to 3 people, using only one transmit antenna and three laptops as receivers (a total of four off-the-shelf Intel 5300 WiFi Network Interface Cards (NICs)). Our results show highly accurate tracking (mean error of 38 cm in outdoor areas/closed parking lots, and 55 cm in indoor areas) using minimal WiFi resources on only one side of the area.},

abstract = {Today, most sensors that harvest energy from indoor solar, ambient RF, or thermal gradients buffer small amounts of energy in capacitors as they intermittently work through a sensing task. While the utilization of capacitors for energy storage affords these systems indefinite lifetimes, their low energy capacity necessitates complex intermittent programming models for state retention and energy management. However, recent advances in battery technology lead us to reevaluate the impact that increased energy storage capacity may have on the necessity of these programming models and the reliability of energy harvesting sensors.In this paper, we propose a capacity-based framework to help structure energy harvesting sensor design, analyze the impact of capacity on key reliability metrics using a data-driven simulation, and consider how backup energy storage alters the design space. We find that for many designs that utilize solar energy harvesting, increasing energy storage capacity to 1-10 mWh can obviate the need for intermittent programming techniques, augment the total harvested energy by 1.4-2.3x, and improve the availability of a sensor by 1.3-2.6x. We also show that a hybrid design using energy harvesting with a secondary-cell battery and a backup primary-cell battery can achieve 2-4x the lifetime of primary-cell only designs while eliminating the failure modes present in energy harvesting systems. Finally, we implement an indoor, solar energy harvesting sensor based on our analysis and find that its behavior aligns with our simulation's predictions.},

abstract = {Scheduling to avoid packet collisions is a long-standing challenge in networking, and has become even trickier in wireless networks with multiple senders and multiple receivers. In fact, researchers have proved that even perfect scheduling can only achieve R = O(1/lnN). Here N is the number of nodes in the network, and R is the medium utilization rate.Ideally, one would hope to achieve R = Θ(1), while avoiding all the complexities in scheduling. To this end, this paper proposes cross-sender bit-mixing coding (BMC), which does not rely on scheduling. Instead, users transmit simultaneously on suitably-chosen slots, and the amount of overlap in different user's slots is controlled via coding. We prove that in all possible network topologies, using BMC enables us to achieve R = Θ(1). We also prove that the space and time complexities of BMC encoding/decoding are all low-order polynomials.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach to acoustic event classification that exploits knowledge from the textual domain to deal with a well-known pain point in audio event classification---i.e., the lack of adequate training examples. We show that by exploiting existing context-aware semantic representation of English words (e.g., Google's word-to-vector [33]) that is generated from a massive amount of English texts on the Internet, it is possible to classify acoustic events even when there are a few or no training examples for a wide variety of sounds. Our approach works in application scenarios where a system wants to learn a number of predefined categories of acoustic events, but it does not have enough training examples per category, and/or for some categories, it does not have any training examples at all. We solve this problem by combining a robust audio representation step, followed by a cross-modal projection of the audio representation onto textual representation. Our approach is different from techniques such as one-shot and data augmentation that do not consider the cross-domain knowledge transfers. We develop a generic mobile application for audio event detection where a user can input a list of desired sound types, along with training audio clips for some of those sound types, and the system is able to recognize all types of sounds (at varying level of accuracy depending on the number of classes that do not have any training examples), which is not achievable by any existing audio classifier that we are aware of. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system on an empirical dataset [41] as well as by deploying the application in two real-world scenarios. The accuracy of the classifier lies between 60\%-90\% for a 6--10 class problem when the number of classes that do not have any training examples is varied between 2--5.},

In the lowest power mode, our camera board consumes only 9.7mW and continuously transmits images for over one month on two AA batteries. We introduce a novel power management system that incorporates input from the camera itself to increase battery life up to 62\%. Using images and system metadata as input, we designed a feedback system between the sensor and the gateway. This allows dynamic vision application requirements to be met while consuming as little power as possible. For example, our system can temporarily increase the resolution after an object of interest is detected, then reduce it again after it has disappeared. This increases the accuracy of simplistic facial recognition by at least 25\% compared to operating constantly in the lowest power mode. We implement communications using a full-duplex WiFi backscatter radio, ensuring compatibility with commodity WiFi devices. We also designed an efficient data streaming and compression pipeline straight from the camera to the backscatter transmitter, allowing us to minimize latency and avoid expensive memory writes. We deployed BackCam in a real office environment, and as a proof-of-concept, implemented basic realtime face detection and recognition.},

abstract = {Aggressive tennis shots with high ball speed are the key factor in winning a tennis match. Today's tennis players are increasingly focused on improving ball speed. As a result, in recent tennis tournaments, records of tennis shot speeds are broken again and again. The traditional method for calculating the tennis ball speed uses multiple high-speed cameras and computer vision technology. This method is very expensive and hard to set up. Another way to calculate the tennis ball speed is to use motion sensors, which are lower cost and easier to set up. In this paper, we propose an approach for tennis ball speed estimation based on a racket-mounted motion sensor. We divide the tennis strokes into three categories: serve, groundstroke, and volley. For a serve, a regression model is proposed to estimate the ball speed. For a groundstroke or volley, two models are proposed: a regression model and a physical model. We use the physical model to estimate the ball speed for advanced players and the regression model for beginner players. Under the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation test, evaluation results show that TennisEye is 10.8\% more accurate than the state-of-the-art work.},

abstract = {Great public speakers are made, not born. Practicing a presentation in front of colleagues is common practice and results in a set of subjective judgements what could be improved. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a mobile app which estimates the quality of speaker's delivery in real time in a fair, repeatable and privacy-preserving way. Quantle estimates the speaker's pace in terms of the number of syllables, words and clauses, computes pitch and duration of pauses. The basic parameters are then used to estimate the talk complexity based on readability scores from the literature to help the speaker adjust his delivery to the target audience. In contrast to speech-to-text-based methods used to implement a digital presentation coach, Quantle does processing locally in real time and works in the flight mode. This design has three implications: (1) Quantle does not interfere with the surrounding hardware, (2) it is power-aware, since 95.2\% of the energy used by the app on iPhone 6 is spent to operate the built-in microphone and the screen, and (3) audio data and processing results are not shared with a third party therewith preserving speaker's privacy.We evaluate Quantle on artificial, online and live data. We artificially modify an audio sample by changing the volume, speed, tempo, pitch and noise level to test robustness of Quantle and its performance limits. We then test Quantle on 1017 TED talks held in English and compare computed features to those extracted from the available transcript processed by online text evaluation services. Quantle estimates of syllable and word counts are 85.4\% and 82.8\% accurate, and pitch is over 90\% accurate. We use the outcome of this study to extract typical ranges for each vocal characteristic. We then use Quantle on live data at a social event, and as a tool for speakers to track their delivery when rehearsing a talk. Our results confirm that Quantle is robust to different noise levels, varying distances from the sound source, phone orientation, and achieves comparable performance to speech-to-text methods.},

abstract = {We present Heartbeats-2-Bits (H2B), which is a system for securely pairing wearable devices by generating a shared secret key from the skin vibrations caused by heartbeat. This work is motivated by potential power saving opportunity arising from the fact that heartbeat intervals can be detected energy-efficiently using inexpensive and power-efficient piezo sensors, which obviates the need to employ complex heartbeat monitors such as Electrocardiogram or Photoplethysmogram. Indeed, our experiments show that piezo sensors can measure heartbeat intervals on many different body locations including chest, wrist, waist, neck and ankle. Unfortunately, we also discover that the heartbeat interval signal captured by piezo vibration sensors has low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) because they are not designed as precision heartbeat monitors, which becomes the key challenge for H2B. To overcome this problem, we first apply a quantile function-based quantization method to fully extract the useful entropy from the noisy piezo measurements. We then propose a novel Compressive Sensing-based reconciliation method to correct the high bit mismatch rates between the two independently generated keys caused by low SNR. We prototype H2B using off-the-shelf piezo sensors and evaluate its performance on a dataset collected from different body positions of 23 participants. Our results show that H2B has a pairing success rate of 95.6\%. We also analyze and demonstrate H2B's robustness against three types of attacks. Finally, our power measurements show that H2B is very power-efficient.},

abstract = {Understanding the location of acoustically reflective surfaces in a room is a critical component in advanced sound processing. For example, intelligent speakers can use a room's acoustic geometry to improve playback quality, source separation accuracy, and speech recognition. In this paper, we present Synesthesia, a system for capturing the acoustic properties of a room using a single fixed speaker and a mobile phone that records audio at multiple locations. Using the arrival time of echoes, the system is able to reconstruct the position of reflective surfaces like walls and then estimate properties like surface absorption.Previous work has shown how the acoustic room impulse response (RIR) of an environment can be used to analyze echoes within a space to reconstruct room geometry. The best current RIR-based approaches rely on high-end equipment and capturing an acoustic signal broadcast into space from a known fixed constellation of microphones. They also require the precise calibration and measurement of microphone positions. In addition, most approaches pose constraints on room geometries and limit the order of RIR to achieve accurate and consistent results. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that performs RIR imaging using a mobile phone that tracks its location with visual inertial odometry (VIO) to record a dense set of samples albeit with noise in their locations. We present a new approach that is able to relax several key assumptions on RIR and show through both experimentation and simulation that even with 20cm of uncertainty in the microphone locations provided by VIO, we are still able to reconstruct the room geometry with accurate shape and dimensions. We demonstrate this capability by prototyping a tool for acoustic engineers, that allows a user to view a room's estimated geometry and absorption overlaid on the actual sensed space with augmented reality.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide Area Networks, such as LoRaWAN, are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of wireless sensing and actuation. While LoRaWAN is heavily studied in applications and performance, the concept of time has rarely been characterized in such networks. Many applications will require synchronized local clocks with varying levels of precision in order to maintain consistency and coordination in the network. Traditional time synchronization protocols however do not fit LoRaWAN's delay-inherent, low duty cycle, network model and wide-area deployment topology. Meanwhile, relying on GPS for time is not an option for low-power applications.In this paper, we present LongShoT, a time synchronization scheme built on LoRaWAN capable of synchronizing device clocks to within 10μs of a reference clock with a single network request. This is achieved by utilizing the deterministic properties of LoRaWAN networks along with hardware- and MAC-level timestamping of packets. LongShoT was implemented on consumer off-the-shelf hardware and evaluated over physically distributed devices using GPS 1PPS as a reference. Our results show that LongShoT achieves an average synchronization error of less than 2μs and compensates oscillator drift to less than 0.1ppm with devices distributed within 4km of a gateway.},

abstract = {LoRa is an emerging low-power wide-area network technology. Existing studies have focused on LoRa's communication performance. Differently, we study two physical properties of LoRa, i.e., its performance in timing the signal propagation and the transmitters' frequency traits. Signal timing is a basis for implementing clock synchronization, ranging, and advanced physical (PHY) layer techniques such as concurrent decoding. However, LoRa end devices do not provide PHY-layer timestamping that is needed for accurate timing. We propose a SoftLoRa design that integrates a low-power software-defined radio receiver with a LoRa transceiver to provide PHY-layer access. Experiments show that SoftLoRa achieves microseconds timing accuracy over one kilometer and in a multistory building with strong signal attenuation.Signal propagation timing is in general susceptible to a frame delay attack. We implement this attack against LoRa by a combination of stealthy jamming and delayed replay. To address the attack, we investigate the inherent frequency biases of LoRa transmitters. With an efficient signal processing algorithm, our frequency bias estimation achieves a resolution of 0.14 parts-per-million (ppm) of the channel's central frequency. This resolution is sufficient to detect the attack that introduces an additional frequency bias of one or more ppm. In summary, this work provides an accurate and secure LoRa-based timing approach based on the SoftLoRa design.},

abstract = {Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) collects city-scale sensing data with low cost and high efficiency. One important goal of MCS is to ensure high quality of sensing coverage to provide sufficient information to data analysis end. However, the goal of the MCS may be inconsistent with the goal of vehicles. This inconsistency between goals results in a bad sensing coverage and decreases the quality of the collected information. Key challenges to resolve this inconsistency include the heterogeneous target desired spatio-temporal distributions, limited budget constraining the ability to incentivize more taxis, and high computational complexity.This work shows a vehicle dispatching system to optimize the sensing coverage of the sampled data with a limited budget and taxis. Our system models the objective function using the similarity between the collected data distribution and target distribution, and introduces an algorithm combining vehicle mobility prediction and ride request prediction to obtain an approximate-optimal vehicle dispatching strategy in an efficient way. The preliminary experiment based on the real-world data shows a significant improvement of the sensing coverage.},

abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in various research areas and application domains, namely the discrimination of abnormal samples from normal samples where training data are only composed of one class (normal) while testing data contains both among which the majority are normal samples. However, previous works can not effectively fit the distribution of high dimensional data and suffers from low AUC scores which measures the classification performance of imbalanced data. To solve these problems, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model based on GAN, i.e., UAD-GAN. Specifically, we adopt transfer learning to extract visual features with pre-trained Inception-v3 model and use the discriminator to detect anomalies. UAD-GAN can fit the data distribution and detect anomalies efficiently. Extensive experiments show that UAD-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other approaches.},

A prior study [1] proposed a LoRa-based wireless mesh network that supported periodic data collection. In this study, we further evaluated how data recovery mechanisms and time-critical data transmission affect periodic data communication, and a data transmission recovery mechanism was developed to recover lost data. Additionally, in emergency situations (e.g., detecting fire or alarm events), the sensor's data must be immediately sent to the control center. In a LoRa mesh network, these time-critical data packets, called non-periodic packets (NPPs), are designed to minimize transmission delays. We deployed 20 nodes on our university campus to form a LoRa mesh network, and the system achieved an average 99.99\% packet delivery ratio with the data recovery mechanism for periodic reporting data. For NPPs, the average transmission delays achieved were 2.284 seconds, 4.597 seconds, and 6.75 seconds to deliver data to the gateway in one-hop, two-hop, and three-hop scenarios, respectively.},

We decompose vibration responses to obtain signal peaks that correspond to temporal gait information and leverage foot dominance to learn a signal amplitude-footstep ground reaction force transfer function.

The prototype shows effective particle gathering, filtering and concentration in a tiny sized area. As a result, we reduce particle loss and improve image quality taken by the optical system when searching and autofocusing on pollen grains. Our first prototype collects raw time-stamped data and transmits these to the backend server where we plan to run the detection and classification algorithms to extract accurate pollen counts from microscopic images. The key advantage of processing images at the backend is that we let the experts undertake corrective actions and help the system learn to detect and classify pollen using state-of-the-art interactive imitation learning algorithms. The final model can then run locally on embedded hardware.},

abstract = {Communication in the underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) faces many challenges due to the acoustic wave characteristics. Acoustic wave has very limited bandwidth, long propagation delay, high bit error rate (BER), and unreliable communication compared to the radio wave. Therefore, media access control (MAC) protocols proposed in terrestrial wireless sensor networks (TWSNs) cannot be implemented underwater as TWSNs rely on radio waves and enables multiple transmissions at a time without causing a collision. Besides, underwater nodes operate in a half-duplex mode and only allows one transmission at a time. Designing an efficient MAC protocol for underwater time-sensitive applications, such as the oil/gas pipeline and climate change prediction applications is necessary. While each application has its own requirements, the software-based approach promises great enhancements to meet more than one application's requirements. The software-based approach allows us to reconfigure the variables through a software without additional hardware requirements. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a software-based MAC protocol that utilizes optical and acoustic wave for communication and allows multiple transmissions at a time in different directions. This study aims to maximize throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR) network utilization while minimizing latency.},

abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the fusion of machine learning (ML) and batteryless computing systems enables true lifelong learning in mobile devices. The lack of learning from experience in current batteryless systems makes them ignorant of changes in their operating environment. Due to high communication cost, latency, privacy, and dependency issues of offloading computation to an edge device, on-device training is a solution for batteryless systems to learn and adapt in dynamically changing environments. Combining batteryless systems and ML is however a challenging task. Sporadic energy supply and limited resources in a batteryless system cause execution-discontinuity and data-constraints in ML processes. To understand these challenges, we identify suitable ML tasks for such systems and study the energy producers, i.e., harvesters, and consumers, i.e., intermittently executable tasks in a ML pipeline. Using a trace-driven simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of on-device training of a batteryless learner.},

Existing IoT nodes can provide the unmodulated carrier needed by the new nodes, avoiding the need for additional infrastructure. This, however, puts extra energetic demands on constrained IoT nodes while increasing interference and contention in the network. We use a slotted MAC protocol to guarantee synchronization between transmitters, receivers and carrier generators. We then express the slot allocation problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) that parallelizes interrogations to battery-free tags when they do not collide with each other and reuses carriers for multiple tags looking to minimize the total time and the number of carrier generators needed to interrogate a set of tags. In networks with sufficient battery-free nodes we obtain a 25\% reduction in the number of necessary carriers and a 50\% decrease in interrogation time in most cases; leading to significant energy savings, reduced collisions and improved latency.},

While the utilization of capacitors for energy storage affords these systems indefinite lifetimes, their low energy capacity necessitates complex intermittent programming models for state retention and energy management. Recent advances in battery technology lead us to reevaluate the impact that increased energy storage capacity may have on the necessity of these programming models and the reliability and lifetime of energy harvesting sensors.Permamote, presented at IPSN 2019, is designed to explore the benefits of larger capacity energy harvesting Instead of a capacitor, Permamote utilizes a small lithium battery to store harvested energy. The inclusion and size of this battery was determined based on device reliability and lifetime modelling using real indoor solar irradiance traces. Permamote additionally includes a backup, non-rechargeable battery that allows continuous operation even for long periods of no available harvestable energy. In this demo, we present Permamote performing continuous and reliable sensing over a Thread (6LoWPAN 802.15.4) mesh network. Additionally, we show the end-to-end cloud infrastructure supporting connected Permamotes, with the intention of showing that energy harvesting with higher capacity enables more capable sensing.},

abstract = {The Dual Processor Platform (DPP) is a novel architecture template for networked embedded systems based on a strictly asynchronous processor interconnect that allows to minimize interference with a proven predictable behavior [7]. Contrary to traditional platforms [1, 5] DPP tries to mitigate interference by isolating different tasks and mapping them onto dedicated hardware resources. Typically, two different task sets - (i) sensing/actuation/data processing and (ii) communication - are mapped onto two different physically separated processing elements (usually low-power microcontrollers), allowing each to be optimized according to their individual requirements. Such hardware partitioning is a standard approach, frequently found in more complex sensor system implementations [2]. While the communication processor handles wireless packet transmission and reception, the application processor is dedicated to the sensor data acquisition, processing and actuation. But this strict separation of resources and function also requires a processor interconnect: BOLT [7], a stateful processor interconnect specifically designed based on this paradigm allows a strict decoupling of the power, clock and time domains of the two processing elements by allowing only asynchronous message passing between the two. The strict limitation to an asynchronous interface allows for predictable run-time behavior that, in addition to typical behavior observed from experiments, has been formally verified [7]. The most notable advantages of this approach are:Modularity Exchanging one of the components is hassle free and does not require a change to the other components.Simpler software The complexity of software development and validation is significantly reduced by task decoupling.Parallel development Development of the two separate entities can take place independently.Independent power management Each subsystem can take independent decisions on when to utilize low-power modes.},

Our solution aims to be easy to install by using an IoT-standardized and low-power sub-GHz radio as backbone communication medium. Furthermore, using this low-power radio allows us to decrease the overall energy consumption of the anchors.

abstract = {Extravasation is a common hazard in intravenous (IV) therapy; especially infants aged 0--2 years old are at high risk. However, in clinical practice, nursing staff are responsible for checking the injection status regularly, which leads to the risk of delayed treatment of extravasation of IV therapy in children. In this study, we propose a sensor-fusion sensing system to detect the early signs of extravasation. Sensor fusion compensates for the limitation of using a single sensor, extends the measurement range, and is more resistant to environmental interference. We design an experimental platform to simulate the occurrence of extravasation and, through this demonstration, show the advantages and feasibility of the proposed concept of using hybrid sensors.},

abstract = {We present TotTernary, the first infrastructure-free, long-term research platform which enables domain scientists to measure human interactions with previously unprecedented accuracy and flexibility. The platform can be tailored to varying scenarios by adjusting the ranging fidelity and the update rate and demonstrates dynamic adaptation to its environment. As a mobile, accurate, and reliable system for ranging measurements, it allows users to gather both distance and position information with decimeter accuracy. Measuring only 61 X 35 mm and weighing 7.7 g, it integrates two radios to achieve both low-power neighbour discovery and direct user interactions using Bluetooth Low Energy as well as precise ultra-wideband ranging measurements. The system introduces a novel energy-efficient ranging protocol with linear message complexity to achieve life times of up to 39 days. Furthermore, leveraging both antenna and frequency diversity, we demonstrate that the median ranging error can be reduced by up to 86\% through an efficient aggregation of measurements over multiple channels. Our system is capable of highly reliable and consistent measurements with as little as 14.8 cm of ranging error in the 99th percentile and a 90\% confidence interval of 11.3 cm.},

abstract = {In this demo, we present SnapLoc, a UWB-based indoor localization system that allows decimeter-accurate self-localization of mobile tags by listening to only a single message. To this end, SnapLoc leverages (quasi-)simultaneous responses of multiple anchors. Based on these responses, the tag derives the time difference of arrival between anchors and unambiguously estimates its position. Thanks to this principle, SnapLoc carries out passive localization and supports an unlimited number of tags at high update rates. Our SnapLoc implementation runs on the off-the-shelf Decawave DW1000 UWB transceiver. The latter suffers from a limited transmit timestamp resolution that affects the achievable localization accuracy when used in conjunction with concurrent anchor responses. Therefore, in this demo we also showcase techniques to overcome these limitations and achieve nevertheless a high localization accuracy.},

abstract = {We present Deskbuddy, a vibration-based system that can track a user's activities through their desk. Tracking sitting and other office related activities let us remind the user to have healthier working habits, as well as giving information about how office spaces are used. Many solutions have been proposed for office activity tracking, but they either require the user to wear a device, or they use cameras or microphones, which can make subjects uncomfortable. Our demo includes a small vibration sensor that sits on a table that can detect four office related activities. We capture the signal from the vibration sensor, extract features, and perform classification on the resulting features. The full functionality of the system will be shown in a video. In order for our demo to be more effective in a crowded environment, we have re-trained it to detect only typing versus not typing.},

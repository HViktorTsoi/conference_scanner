abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) will be an essential function of various emerging applications. However, HAR typically encounters challenges related to modality limitations and label scarcity, leading to an application gap between current solutions and real-world requirements. In this work, we propose MESEN, a multimodal-empowered unimodal sensing framework, to utilize unlabeled multimodal data available during the HAR model design phase for unimodal HAR enhancement during the deployment phase. From a study on the impact of supervised multimodal fusion on unimodal feature extraction, MESEN is designed to feature a multi-task mechanism during the multimodal-aided pre-training stage. With the proposed mechanism integrating cross-modal feature contrastive learning and multimodal pseudo-classification aligning, MESEN exploits unlabeled multimodal data to extract effective unimodal features for each modality. Subsequently, MESEN can adapt to downstream unimodal HAR with only a few labeled samples. Extensive experiments on eight public multimodal datasets demonstrate that MESEN achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in enhancing unimodal HAR by exploiting multimodal data.},

abstract = {This paper introduces SudokuSens, a generative framework for automated generation of training data in machine-learning-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such that the generated synthetic data mimic experimental configurations not encountered during actual sensor data collection. The framework improves the robustness of resulting deep learning models, and is intended for IoT applications where data collection is expensive. The work is motivated by the fact that IoT time-series data entangle the signatures of observed objects with the confounding intrinsic properties of the surrounding environment and the dynamic environmental disturbances experienced. To incorporate sufficient diversity into the IoT training data, one therefore needs to consider a combinatorial explosion of training cases that are multiplicative in the number of objects considered and the possible environmental conditions in which such objects may be encountered. Our framework substantially reduces these multiplicative training needs. To decouple object signatures from environmental conditions, we employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that allows us to reduce data collection needs from multiplicative to (nearly) linear, while synthetically generating (data for) the missing conditions. To obtain robustness with respect to dynamic disturbances, a session-aware temporal contrastive learning approach is taken. Integrating the aforementioned two approaches, SudokuSens significantly improves the robustness of deep learning for IoT applications. We explore the degree to which SudokuSens benefits downstream inference tasks in different data sets and discuss conditions under which the approach is particularly effective.},

abstract = {This paper presents RF Genesis (RFGen), a novel and cost-effective method for synthesizing RF sensing data using cross-modal diffusion models, in order to improve the generalization capability of millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing systems. Traditional machine learning models used in mmWave sensing struggle with limited training datasets. Their performance degrades drastically when confronted with unseen users, environments, sensor configurations, test classes, etc. RFGen mitigates these challenges by using a cross-modal generative framework to synthesize and expand mmWave sensing data. We specifically propose a custom ray tracing simulator to simulate RF propagation and interaction with objects/environments. We then leverage a set of diffusion models to generate massive 3D scenes, and transform the visual scene representation into the corresponding mmWave sensing data, under the direction of application-specific "prompts". Our proposed approach reconciles the physics-based ray tracing with the blackbox diffusion model, leading to accurate, scalable, and explainable vision-to-RF data synthesis. Our extensive real-world experiments highlight RFGen's effectiveness in diverse mmWave sensing applications, enhancing their generalization to unseen test cases without laborious data collection.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency (RF)-based gait recognition has emerged as a promising technology to authenticate individuals in a pervasive and unobtrusive way. However, a fundamental challenge remains in collecting extensive data of the same user in the same environment. To address this challenge, this paper introduces XGait, a cross-modal gait recognition framework that does not require the prior deployment of RF devices or explicit data collection. The key idea is to leverage the signals of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which is widely available in modern mobile devices, to simulate the RF signals that would be generated if the same person walked near RF devices. Despite the straightforward idea, several technical challenges need to be addressed due to the diversity of RF devices, the intrinsic difference between IMU signals and RF signals, and the complexity of gait. First, we propose an RF spectrogram generation method to consistently extract essential RF gait data features across different RF signals. Secondly, we propose a generative network-enabled IMU-to-RF translation approach that accurately converts IMU data to RF data. Finally, we design an RF gait spectrogram-specific transformer model to further improve the recognition performance. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of XGait, involving thirty subjects in three different environments, utilizing three RF devices and seven mobile devices. Experimental results show that XGait consistently achieves over 99\% Top-3 accuracy in various scenarios.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has shown great promise for privacy-preserving learning by enabling collaborative training on decentralized clients. However, in realistic FL scenarios, clients often collect new data continuously, join or exit learning dynamically. As a result, the global model tends to forget old knowledge while learning new knowledge. Meanwhile, labeling the continuously arriving data in real-time is usually challenging. Therefore, the catastrophic forgetting problem intertwined with the label deficiency issue poses significant challenges for both learning new knowledge and consolidating old knowledge. To address these challenges, we develop a novel exemplar-free continual federated learning framework named FedINC, to learn a global incremental model with limited labeled data. We begin by excavating the cause of catastrophic forgetting via in-depth empirical studies. Based on that, we introduce targeted mechanisms for FedINC, including a hybrid contrastive learning mechanism to efficiently learn new knowledge with limited labeled data, a plastic feature regularization mechanism to preserve old task's representation space, a prototype-guided regularization mechanism to mitigate feature overlap between old and new classes while aligning the features of non-iid clients, and a prototype evolution mechanism for flexible and efficient incremental classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedINC in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy of the global model.},

abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technology that enables physical-layer direct communication from a WiFi sender to other Internet of Things (IoT) receivers via waveform emulation. The previous works use the reverse engineering to find the appropriate WiFi payload that can emulate the waveform similar to the desired IoT packet in the format of the IoT protocol (e.g., ZigBee). Unfortunately, the reverse engineering approach suffers from many limitations, such as being non-reversible and unscalable, misaligning symbols, and over-relying on empiricism. In this work, we present XiTuXi, a one-size-fits-all solution to automatically achieve the CTC by taking advantage of the neural machine translation (NMT), inspired by the task comparability between CTC and homophony-based cross-linguistic communication. We employ a well-known NMT model called Transformer to learn the bit-sequence to bit-sequence translation rationale behind the CTC without human intervention. Particularly, we introduce the forward engineering to address the dilemma of acquiring training datasets. By using XiTuXi, we achieved the CTC with 30 protocol combinations (ie., 802.11b, g, n, ax, ah \r{A} ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and Sigfox) effortlessly, which ultimately liberates the experts from previous tedious tasks.},

abstract = {Sensors measuring real-life physical processes are ubiquitous in today's interconnected world. These sensors inherently bear noise that often adversely affects the performance and reliability of the systems they support. Classic filtering approaches introduce strong assumption on the time or frequency characteristics of sensory measurements, while learning-based denoising approaches typically rely on using ground truth clean data to train a denoising model, which is often challenging or prohibitive to obtain for many real-world applications. We observe that in many scenarios, the relationships between different sensor measurements (e.g., location and acceleration) are analytically described by laws of physics (e.g., second-order differential equation). By incorporating such physics constraints, we can guide the denoising process to improve performance even in the absence of ground truth data. In light of this, we design a physics-informed denoising model that leverages the inherent algebraic relationships between different measurements governed by the underlying physics. By obviating the need for ground truth clean data, our method offers a practical denoising solution for real-world applications. We conducted experiments in various domains, including inertial navigation, CO2 monitoring, and HVAC control, and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with existing denoising methods. Our method can denoise data in real time (4ms for a sequence of 1s) for low-cost noisy sensors and produces results that closely align with those from high-precision, high-cost alternatives, leading to an efficient, cost-effective approach for more accurate sensor-based systems.},

abstract = {Many applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, require the concurrent running of multiple deep neural networks (DNN) that poses different levels of real-time performance requirements. However, coordinating multiple DNN tasks with varying levels of criticality on edge GPUs remains an area of limited study. Unlike server-level GPUs, edge GPUs are resource-limited and lack hardware-level resource management mechanisms for avoiding resource contention. Therefore, we propose Miriam, a contention-aware task coordination framework for multi-DNN inference on edge GPU. Miriam consolidates two main components, an elastic-kernel generator, and a runtime dynamic kernel coordinator, to support mixed critical DNN inference. To evaluate Miriam, we build a new DNN inference benchmark based on CUDA with diverse representative DNN workloads. Experiments on two edge GPU platforms show that Miriam can increase system throughput by 92\% while only incurring less than 10\% latency overhead for critical tasks, compared to state of art baselines.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely deployed on IoT devices with the help of advancements in DL algorithms and chips. However, the limited resources of edge devices make these on-device DL models hard to be generalizable to diverse environments and tasks. Although the recently emerged foundation models (FMs) show impressive generalization power, how to effectively leverage the rich knowledge of FMs on resource-limited edge devices is still not explored. In this paper, we propose EdgeFM, a novel edge-cloud cooperative system with open-set recognition capability. EdgeFM selectively uploads unlabeled data to query the FM on the cloud and customizes the specific knowledge and architectures for edge models. Meanwhile, EdgeFM conducts dynamic model switching at run-time taking into account both data uncertainty and dynamic network variations, which ensures the accuracy always close to the original FM. We implement EdgeFM using two FMs on two edge platforms. We evaluate EdgeFM on three public datasets and two self-collected datasets. Results show that EdgeFM can reduce the end-to-end latency up to 3.2x and achieve 34.3\% accuracy increase compared with the baseline.},

With nnPerf, the mobile developers can easily identify the bottleneck in model run-time efficiency and optimize the model architecture to meet system-level objectives (SLO). We implement nnPerf on TFLite framework and evaluate its e2e-, operator-, and kernel-latency profiling accuracy across four mobile platforms. The results show that nnPerf achieves consistently high latency profiling accuracy on both CPU (98.12\%) and GPU (99.87\%). Our benchmark studies demonstrate that running nnPerf on mobile devices introduces the minimum overhead to model inference, with 0.231\% and 0.605\% extra inference latency and power consumption. We further run a case study to show how we leverage nnPerf to migrate OFA, a SOTA NAS system, to kernel-oriented model optimization on GPUs.},

abstract = {Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity.In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics.As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8\% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7\texttimes{}), end-to-end latency by 80.8--94.2\%, and energy consumption by 80.9--94.2\%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

abstract = {We introduce On-NAS, a memory-efficient on-device neural architecture search (NAS) solution, that enables memory-constrained embedded devices to find the best deep model architecture and train it on the device. Based on the cell-based differentiable NAS, it drastically curtails the massive memory requirement of architecture search, one of the major bottlenecks in realizing NAS on embedded devices. On-NAS first pre-trains a basic architecture block, called meta cell, by combining n cells into a single condensed cell via two-fold meta-learning, which can flexibly evolve to various architectures, saving the device storage space n times. Then, the offline-learned meta cell is loaded onto the device and unfolded to perform online on-device NAS via 1) expectation-based operation and edge pair search, enabling memory-efficient partial architecture search by reducing the required memory up to k and m/4 times, respectively, given k candidate operations and m nodes in a cell, and 2) step-by-step back-propagation that saves the memory usage of the backward pass of the n-cell architecture up to n times. To the best of our knowledge, On-NAS is the first standalone NAS and training solution fully operable on embedded devices with limited memory. Our experiment results show that On-NAS effectively identifies optimal architectures and trains it on the device, on par with GPU-based NAS in both few-shot and full-task learning settings, e.g., even 1.3\% higher accuracy on miniImageNet, while reducing the run-time memory and storage usage up to 20x and 4x, respectively.},

abstract = {Fingerprint recognition has been a vital security guard for various applications whose vulnerability has been explored by different works. However, previous works on spoofing fingerprint recognition rely on prior knowledge (e.g., photos and minutiae) of the target fingerprint, which fails to implement in practical scenarios. In this paper, we design a fingerprint spoofing attack, namely FingerFaker, to explore the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition, which can spoof automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) without prior knowledge of target fingerprints. Specifically, we propose a novel concept of "pseudo-minutiae-set" as an effective optimization object and design a two-stage scheme to optimize "pseudo-minutiaeset" leveraging a two-factor evolutionary strategy. In addition, we use a GAN-based training strategy with a minutiae loss function to pre-train a fingerprint generator to map a "pseudo-minutiae-set" into a fingerprint. We use 6342 fingerprint images to verify the performance of FingerFaker on spoofing the open-source AFRS, which shows a high attack success rate (ASR) of 97.78\%. Meanwhile, we conduct a realistic case study on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AFRS, where FingerFaker also shows 94.22\% ASR. Finally, we explore the impact of different conditions to guide the attack and propose countermeasures to mitigate the harm.},

We utilize characteristics of a rolling-shutter camera as a frequency filter whose function depends on its shutter opening ratio. By using one test photo image, the proposed method can judge whether it was taken with an authorized or unauthorized camera. When the value of an authorized shutter opening ratio is updated periodically or randomly on an authorized camera only, it is possible to use a frequency spectrum of a photo taken by the camera as its own one-time fingerprint. Technical details of the proposed method are described and its characteristics are established through controlled and laboratory-setting experiments. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can achieve an f1-score of 99.1\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9997. Causes of correct and wrong detection results are investigated and the robustness of the proposed method is discussed using compressed and resized photo images.

abstract = {The emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique introduces novel threats to wireless sensing owing to its channel customization ability. Unlike active radios, the RIS's interference behaves akin to natural reflections, exhibiting a higher level of stealthiness and difficulty in detection. However, the majority of current RIS-based attacks lack generalizability to real-world scenarios, as they assume complete coverage of the RIS over objects and develop their techniques within electromagnetic-controlled environments such as an anechoic chamber. To bridge this gap, we present RIStealth, a practical and covert attack that leverages RIS technology to render a moving individual undetectable by WiFi-based intrusion detection systems in real-life scenarios. RIStealth integrates the strengths of both motion reduction and threshold lifting strategies to address challenges of limited RIS affordability, constrained cooperation in adversary settings, and complex and unpredictable environments. Through real-world evaluations conducted with our RIS prototype, we demonstrate that RIStealth effectively reduces the victim's intrusion detection rate from 95.1\% to 16.4\%. Our findings shed light on the practical threats posed by RIS, thereby encouraging further countermeasure development.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present Jawthenticate, an earable system that authenticates a user using audible or inaudible speech without using a microphone. This system can overcome the shortcomings of traditional voice-based authentication systems like unreliability in noisy conditions and spoofing using microphone-based replay attacks. Jawthenticate derives distinctive speech-related features from the jaw motion and associated facial vibrations. This combination of features makes Jawthenticate resilient to vocal imitations as well as camera-based spoofing. We use these features to train a two-class SVM classifier for each user. Our system is invariant to the content and language of speech. In a study conducted with 41 subjects, who speak different native languages, Jawthenticate achieves a Balanced Accuracy (BAC) of 97.07\%, True Positive Rate (TPR) of 97.75\%, and True Negative Rate (TNR) of 96.4\% with just 3 seconds of speech data.},

abstract = {Radar sensors have recently been explored in the industrial and consumer Internet of Things (IoT). However, such applications often require self-sustainable or untethered operations, which are at odds with the high power consumption of radar. This paper proposes NeuroRadar, a neuromorphic radar sensor, to achieve low-power wireless sensing. NeuroRadar jointly optimizes the analog hardware and the computation model, in order to mimic the highly efficient biological sensing and neural processing system. NeuroRadar features a highly simplified radar front end, which eliminates the power-hungry components in conventional radars. It directly "encodes" ambient motion into spiking signals, which can be processed using spiking neural networks running on energy-efficient neuromorphic computing platforms. We have prototyped NeuroRadar and evaluated its performance in two use cases: gesture sensing and localization. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroRadar can achieve high sensing accuracy, at orders of magnitude lower power consumption compared with traditional radar.},

Nevertheless, due to the cost of a dedicated power meter for each server, most data center power management only focuses on UPS or cluster-level power monitoring. In this paper, we propose a low-cost novel power monitoring approach that uses only one sensor to extract power consumption information of all servers. We utilize the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) of server power supplies to measure their power consumption from non-intrusive single-point voltage measurements. We present a theoretical characterization of conducted EMI generation in server power supply and its propagation through the data center power network. Using a set of ten commercial-grade servers (six Dell PowerEdge and four Lenovo ThinkSystem), we demonstrate that our approach can estimate each server's power consumption with less than ~7\% mean absolute error.},

abstract = {In-time disease assessment is essential to better customize the medication scheme and improve the quality of life for chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Toward the inconvenience problem in current clinical assessment practice, mobile sensing solutions based on detecting Parkinson's vocal changes are proposed. However, current solutions either can only achieve binary disease detection task or require patients to perform specific speaking tasks, which is not effective and practical for disease stage assessment in daily scenario. Moreover, most of existing solutions do not take speech privacy into consideration. In this work, we present PDAssess, a free speech-based daily assessment system that can perform 4-stage Parkinson's disease assessment in a privacy-preserving manner. We observe that current solutions did not fully leverage the rich information embedded in free speech due to the linguistic content variations, and therefore leverage a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to achieve a content variation-aware feature-extraction. In order to distinguish subtle stage-wise differences, we design a novel attention-based neural network architecture with a customized loss function for disease assessment task. Towards the potential privacy leakage problem, we design a Split Learning-based framework with pseudo-labeling and local domain adversarial training to better preserve speech content privacy. We collaborate with a medical center and evaluate the performance of PDAssess on real-world speech data collected from 50 PD subjects and 50 healthy subjects. The evaluation result shows that PDAssess can perform 4-stage PD assessment with an average person-wise F1 score of 89.1\% and voice sample-wise F1 score of 75.1\%.},

abstract = {The demand for masks and air filters with effective filtration capabilities is skyrocketing as there are many applications that require protecting users from inhaling air pollutants or hazardous particles. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a surge in the number of counterfeit and substandard filters attributed to malicious and inept manufacturers. Hence, users are left vulnerable in not knowing which products are reliable. Exacerbating the problem, there are diverse filter standards, each with a unique expression for filtration efficiencies, adding to user confusion. Moreover, the average user lacks the necessary tools, techniques, and knowledge to independently verify the filtration efficiency. Specifically, state-of-the-art solutions are lab-based machines that are extremely expensive and difficult to access for the general public. To solve this problem, we propose FilterOp, a novel smartphone-based mask and filter testing system. FilterOp is a practical solution that allows a user to estimate the filtration efficiency of a mask or a filter using only a pair of commodity smartphones. The novelty of FilterOp comes from its use of light absorption and scattering effects, observed when light propagates through the filter. We evaluate FilterOp in comprehensive real-world experiments using 256 filter instances across 27 different make-and-model products with varying filtration efficiencies. Comparing our results to those obtained with a state-of-the-art government-certified testing machine, we observe that FilterOp yields comparable results with a low mean absolute error of 2.7\%, and detects substandard products with an overall accuracy of 96\%.},

However, real-world conditions can impair the utility of existing road markings. For example, adverse weather conditions such as snow and rain can quickly obliterate visibility.We propose a novel MagnETic ROad marking system (METRO) for robust recognition of road markings at low cost and high deployability. METRO pairs (a) easily deployable passive magnetic road markings with (b) an automotive-grade magnetic sensing framework that detects and interprets these markings. The design of METRO addresses several real-world challenges, such as mitigating the impact of magnetic disturbances, lowering deployment costs, and enhancing the durability of magnetic tags. On-road field tests of METRO demonstrate an overall accuracy of over 96\% in interpreting various road markings in adverse conditions with less cost (only $0.17 per meter) than traditional road markings ($0.21--7.70 per meter). Our field evaluation of METRO over one month demonstrates the practicality and robustness of METRO in real-world settings. Specifically, we observed no performance degradation in the METRO sensor array and no damage or demagnetization to METRO's magnetic tags.},

abstract = {Drowning incidents can occur in swimming pools even with professional lifeguards present. This is because drowning swimmers often face difficulties in calling for help due to choking, making it challenging for lifeguards to recognize them and provide a timely rescue. To address this problem, this paper presents AquaHelper, an underwater SOS system that can transmit and detect acoustic SOS signals in swimming pools. Specifically, a wearable device (e.g., a smartwatch) serves as an underwater SOS transmitter, with which a swimmer can call for help in emergency situations. Multiple underwater acoustic receivers are deployed to detect SOS signals and promptly alert lifeguards. The main challenge lies in the low transmission power of lightweight wearable devices, which poses difficulties in detecting weak SOS signals, particularly in low-SNR underwater scenarios. To achieve reliable underwater SOS detection, AquaHelper develops novel techniques (e.g., incorporating high-order harmonics, multi-scale window aggregation, and coherent combining of multiple receivers) to fully leverage the spectral, temporal, and spatial diversity of underwater acoustic signals. We also describe lessons learned and our solutions to address practical challenges involved in underwater SOS transmission and detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AquaHelper in detecting SOS signals in typical swimming pool environments.},

Recent work has explored NLoS automotive radar sensing systems to detect objects in occluded regions. However, current NLoS radars require substantial ambient reflectors, whose size needs to scale with the desired angular resolution and coverage, impeding their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Metasight, which leverages carefully designed passive millimeter-wave metasurface reflectors and a novel angular encoding scheme to dramatically reduce the reflector size. The Metasight metasurfaces are fully passive, low cost, and can be fabricated by simply using a 3D printer and copper tape. By processing the reflected signals with a robust angle decoding algorithm on the radar, Metasight achieves high NLoS sensing resolution and wide coverage, with an asymptotically higher space-efficiency than conventional natural or artificial reflectors.},

abstract = {This paper presents HandFi, which constructs hand skeletons with practical WiFi devices. Unlike previous WiFi hand sensing systems that primarily employ predefined gestures for pattern matching, by constructing the hand skeleton, HandFi can enable a variety of downstream WiFi-based hand sensing applications in gaming, healthcare, and smart homes. Deriving the skeleton from WiFi signals is challenging, especially because the palm is a dominant reflector compared with fingers. HandFi develops a novel multi-task learning neural network with a series of customized loss functions to capture the low-level hand information from WiFi signals. During offline training, HandFi takes raw WiFi signals as input and uses the leap motion to provide supervision. During online use, only with commercial WiFi, HandFi is capable of producing 2D hand masks as well as 3D hand poses. We demonstrate that HandFi can serve as a foundation model to enable developers to build various applications such as finger tracking and sign language recognition, and outperform existing WiFi-based solutions.

abstract = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal.},

Low-frequency large antenna arrays are rarely deployed in indoor settings due to their large size which makes them bulky and difficult to deploy. By embedding these arrays on existing surfaces such as curtains, we can improve through-wall sensing, beamforming for IoT devices equipped with low-power radios and indoor localization of Bluetooth tags.However, antenna arrays on curtains present new challenges since deformation shifts their phase centers and changes the 3D positions of antennas. We present CurtainNet, a flexible UHFband antenna array on a large surface curtain that leverages a combination of optical and RF tracking to compensate for these changes while dealing with occlusions and phase changes. Results show that CurtainNet outperforms alternative methods by more than 155\% in beamforming performance and increases indoor range by 20m.},

However, as there are few real large-scale deployments, it is unclear whether and how well LoRa can eventually meet its prospects. In this paper, we demystify the real performance of LoRa by deploying and measuring a citywide LoRa network, named CityWAN, which consists of 100 gateways and 19,821 LoRa end nodes, covering an area of 130 km2 for 12 applications. Our measurement focuses on the following perspectives: (i) Performance of applications running on the citywide LoRa network; (ii) Infrastructure efficiency and deployment optimization; (iii) Physical layer signal features and link performance; (iv) Energy profiling and cost estimation for LoRa applications. The results reveal that LoRa performance in urban settings is bottlenecked by the prevalent blind spots, and there is a gap between the gateway efficiency and network coverage for the infrastructure deployment. Besides, we find that LoRa links at the physical layer are susceptible to environmental variations, and LoRa and other LPWANs show diverse costs for different scenarios. Our measurement provides insights for large-scale LoRa network deployment and also for future academic research to fully unleash the potential of LoRa.},

abstract = {WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart applications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade. Most of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work, while a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor environments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for accurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is far from being satisfactory. This paper presents Bifrost, a novel hardwaresoftware co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of Bifrost is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals for localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of signals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in design of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in Channel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise. We implement Bifrost and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results show that the median localization error of Bifrost is 0.81m, which is 52.35\% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when combined with Bifrost to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the localization error by 33.54\%.},

Existing studies on non-line-of-sight imaging rely on expensive equipment or are limited to severe laboratory conditions (e.g., massive planar reflectors and controlled illumination), rendering these technologies inapplicable in complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a non-line-of-sight moving obstacle detection system Ghost-Probe, which can provide an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) with sufficient time to respond and stop safely. We design a shadow signal discriminator to assess the weak shadows created by a moving obstacle, such as pedestrians in the blind area, while simultaneously filtering out the impacts of other complicated illumination. Note that we merely use commercial monocular cameras and our system is robust to a wide range of lighting scenarios and planar reflectors. We evaluate the generalizability of our approach using the datasets collected in real-world driving scenarios with a variety of road surface and lighting circumstances. The results indicate that our system can detect the moving pedestrian in the non-line-of-sight area at a distance of 20 meters and offer the ADAS system advance warning to keep a safe distance.},

abstract = {Daily tracking of small objects or animals anywhere on earth for long time-periods is a long sought-after goal. Recently, the emergence of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites offers a unique pathway to achieve this goal. However, to date, LEO trackers have not achieved cm-size. While the integrated chip can be readily scaled to sub-cm size, the size of trackers remains limited by their battery and antenna size. To address these two fundamental size limiting factors, this paper presents a LEO satellite localization system that is specifically optimized to reduce antenna size and transmit power, thereby reducing battery size. To reduce power, a new cooperative waveform is designed which enhances the localization accuracy, combined with an increased packet length to enable low transmit power while maintaining packet energy. However, this long packet length introduces a intra-packet Doppler shift which we address by proposing a localization algorithm that includes a Doppler shift correction. The final result is a 50 kHz periodic BPSK signal with 23 dBm equivalent isotropic radiation power (EIRP), and 120 ms packet length (> 10 \texttimes{} longer than conventional), at a 60 s interval. The proposed solution enables 7 months operation on a 2.5 \texttimes{} 1.2 cm LiPo battery within a North American search area. To address the antenna size, the optimal transmit frequency was studied and a 1 cm loop antenna with 65\% radiation efficiency was designed with internal matching to 50 Ohm. Using the proposed techniques, three satellite flyover experiments were performed to confirm the accuracy of the proposed tracking system and localization algorithms using a USRP-X310, a custom 1 cm-size antenna, and a commercial satellite cluster. The measured average localization error is 320 - 840 m depending on satellite trajectories, demonstrating an improved accuracy in real life measurements compared to prior art with experimental result while simultaneously achieving 15 -- 26 dB lower transmit power and > 3 \texttimes{} lower packet energy.},

abstract = {This paper presents EmoRI, a novel single-chip mmWave radar-based egomotion estimation approach that works in challenging scenarios where moving objects exist in radar's Field of View (FoV). Essentially, estimating a mobile platform's egomotion using an on-board mmWave radar requires inferring the relative motion between radar and the points of the stationary objects (PSOs) in the radar point cloud. However, in practice, there could be no PSOs because of the blockage of moving objects. Even if PSOs exist, precisely identifying them is still challenging due to (i) the large quantity of points generated by the moving objects, and (ii) the huge angle estimation errors of the conventional point cloud generation algorithm. We empower EmoRI to overcome the above challenges incurred by moving objects with three core techniques, which include (i) a hybrid FFT-MUSIC algorithm that improves the angle estimation accuracy of single-chip mmWave radar, (ii) a multiple stationary target consensus algorithm that precisely selects the PSOs from the radar point cloud, and (iii) a simultaneous fusion and calibration mechanism that introduces an IMU as the auxiliary sensor, meticulously calibrates IMU accelerations with radar measurements, and complimentarily fuses these two modalities to obtain the 6-DoF egomotion. Our extensive experiments validate that EmoRI pushes the limit of single-chip mmWave radar-based egomotion estimation with moving objects in radar's FoV by reducing the per-meter destination error from decimeter to centimeter level.},

abstract = {3D human pose plays a critical role in human behavior understanding and has many applications (e.g., VR/AR). Conventional pose estimations deploy sensors as fixed infrastructure, which significantly restrains the mobility of the user. Inspired by the emerging head-mounted devices (e.g., VR/AR glasses) and the recent advance in low-cost mmWave radar, we present mmEgo, the first egocentric human pose estimation design using a head-mounted mmWave radar, which offers ubiquitous pose tracking with high mobility, robustness to complex environments, and privacy preservation. To tackle the unique challenges of radar sensing from the egocentric perspective (e.g., random radar motion and the scarcity of information on the lower body), we propose several technical designs, including root-relative radar motion tracking for radar motion decoupling and a two-stage pose estimator that incorporates human kinematics priors. Extensive experiments and case studies show that our method can reduce the joint localization error by 44.2\% and potentially enable a wide spectrum of applications.},

abstract = {Multi-user indoor localization is considered to be one of the most useful wireless applications. Low latency and high robustness to dynamic interference from surrounding people are essential requirements for multi-user localization. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) indoor localization systems cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time. In this paper, we propose RIScan, a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided localization system that can achieve both low latency and high reliability. We leverage RIS to perform Wi-Fi beam scanning so all clients can figure out their direction in a single scan. However, compared with traditional AP-based systems, the introduction of RIS creates a more complicated signal superposition at the receiver, preventing clients from directly obtaining target beams for direction derivation and localization. To overcome this challenge, we fully utilize the reconfigurability of RIS to endow target beams with distinguishing features, so that RIScan can extract stable and accurate direction information from complex and dynamic environments. RIScan is implemented in the real system with our own developed 16 \texttimes{} 16 RIS prototype and COTS Wi-Fi devices. Extensive experiments show that RIScan achieves a median localization error of 47cm and 71cm in static and dynamic environments with only two RIS anchors. Compared to the SOTA methods, RIScan reduces the localization latency by more than an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Understanding the location of ultra-wideband (UWB) tag-attached objects and people in the real world is vital to enabling a smooth cyber-physical transition. However, most UWB localization systems today require multiple anchors in the environment, which can be very cumbersome to set up. In this work, we develop XRLoc, providing an accuracy of a few centimeters in many real-world scenarios. This paper will delineate the key ideas that allow us to overcome the fundamental restrictions that plague a single anchor point from localization of a device to within an error of a few centimeters. We deploy a VR chess game using everyday objects as a demo and find that our system achieves 2.4 cm median accuracy and 5.3 cm 90th percentile accuracy in dynamic scenarios, performing at least 8\texttimes{} better than state-of-art localization systems. Additionally, we implement a MAC protocol to furnish these locations for over 10 tags at update rates of 100 Hz, with a localization latency of ~1 ms. We have additionally open-sourced our system's codebase at https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/xrloc.git},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel hybrid simulation system (HybriSim) tailored for simulating distributed learning in mobile settings, such as those involving vehicles and pedestrians navigating through cities. Designed to be learning-method independent, the system is compatible with decentralized learning, federated learning, or a combination of the two. It has special relevance for decentralized learning systems that are sensitive to mobility patterns and rely on direct, device-to-device communication. Existing tools for evaluating resource-intensive tasks in opportunistic networks are either purely simulated, which may not accurately reflect system performance, or take the form of testbeds of real devices, which are difficult to scale to use cases involving huge numbers of devices, such as distributed learning. By integrating real devices with virtual simulated devices, HybriSim more accurately mirrors real-world performance and dynamics. This integration not only mitigates the biases associated with pure simulations but also resolves the deployment complexities of conducting simulations entirely on real devices. Our system sets a new benchmark for academic and industry researchers, facilitating more reliable and actionable insights into distributed learning systems in mobility contexts.},

To enhance positional features, MMLoc reshapes one-dimensional RSSI data into images and jointly utilizes them as inputs to a prediction model. To further optimize the model's performance, the building prediction task works as a prerequisite for floor and coordinate prediction tasks, followed by staged feature extraction and multidimensional data fusion.

abstract = {The rapid growth in wireless embedded systems is threatened by the challenges associated with programming and deploying them. In addition, there is also the complexity inherent in analyzing of the sensor data. Notably, these tasks require high levels of end-user expertise. In this way, an entry barrier is introduced to deploying wireless embedded systems. In this work, we introduce Otter, an end-to-end system designed to simplify these tasks by leveraging the emergent properties of large language models. We demonstrate that Otter allows commodity embedded platforms to capture sensor data, such as light and vibration sensors, which can then be used to identify hand gestures in a near real-time manner. This is all while being prompted using natural language prompts by the end-user. Otter is the first system of its kind and has the potential to facilitate wireless embedded systems proliferation significantly.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in increasing the flexibility and the mobility of industrial infrastructures to support novel industrial applications. To support this change, industrial networks must provide real-time guarantees while integrating a great variety of traffic over a cohesive network infrastructure. Specifically, there is special interest in the integration of wired and wireless communications in the industrial domain. We present a solution that integrates a Time-Sensitive Networking Ethernet network with a low-power 6TiSCH IoT network and discuss the implementation alternatives and their implications on delay and resource consumption. The main goal is to experimentally identify the research challenges and necessary enhancements for interoperability between constrained battery-driven wireless communication with the time sensitive wired networks.},

We changed the distance between PCB boards with 1 cm coils and measured the output voltage induced in one coil when an AC voltage of the resonant frequency is input to the other coil. As a result, a correlation was confirmed between the distance between the coils and the value of the output voltage. We found that the distance between the coils can be estimated from the output voltage even when that distance is more than five times the coil diameter. This method enables distance sensing between objects simply by placing a coil on the object. This allows for the sensing of positional relationships between components used in deformable user interfaces.},

Second, E4's just-in-time (JIT) profiler leverages coordinate descent search to co-optimize the CPU and GPU clock frequencies for each layer before the DNN exit point. Preliminary experimental results show that E4 outperforms exiting methods in terms of power consumption and inference latency.},

abstract = {The rapid development of AI applications powered by deep learning in edge devices boosts the opportunity for real-time health monitoring. To address the potential privacy concern in the inference phase, homomorphic encryption (HE) is an alternative solution that encrypts inference data without exposing raw data and has several distinct advantages, (i.e., single-round communication, lightweight bandwidth consumption, and non-interactive computation). However, the computational overhead on the current HE-based privacy-preserving inference necessitates a substantial amount of time, which is not feasible for some real-time applications on edge devices. To address this issue, we propose CNN-guardian, a unified and compact neural network structure for real-time inference in HE-based inference on edge GPU. CNN-guardian designs a HE-friendly neural network and GPU engine that optimizes HE operations to accelerate the inference in the HE domain.},

abstract = {Detection&tracking framework enables real-time object detection services on resource-limited mobile devices in edge networks, where mobile devices only offload few key frames to edge servers for detection and track the other frames locally. Following this framework, the offloading decisions become more important, as fewer frames can be offloaded and their results can directly affect tracking accuracy of the subsequent frames. To make wise frame offloading decisions, it is crucial to leverage the relationship between the detected frame and the tracked frame. However, the existing studies solely use the content-level information to reflect the above relationship, i.e., they tend to offload the frames with the significant pixel differences from the adjacent frames. Link impact on such relationship is completely ignored, thus leading to significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Kite, a link-adaptive and real-time object detection in dynamic edge networks, which integrates both the link-level and content-level impact into frame offloading. Kite exploits a novel performance metric, "frame-anchor" distance, to indicate the impact of dynamic wireless links. With this metric, we can incorporate both link and content information into the offloading process. The real-world experiment results show that Kite can improve the detection accuracy in dynamic edge networks.},

abstract = {Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has been widely studied for energy-efficient control of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. One of the fundamental issues of the current approaches is the large amount of data required to train an accurate building system dynamics model. In this work, we developed a data-efficient system capable of excellent HVAC control performance with only days of training data. We use a Gaussian Process (GP) as the dynamics model which provides uncertainty for each prediction. To improve the data efficiency, we designed a meta kernel learning technique for GP kernel selection. To incorporate uncertainty in the control decisions, we designed a model predictive control method that considers the uncertainty of every prediction. Simulation experiments show that our method achieves excellent data efficiency, yielding similar energy savings and 12.07\% less human comfort violation compared with the state-of-the-art MBRL method, while only trained on a seven-day training dataset.},

We collect a multi-modal dataset comprising mmWave radar point clouds and RGB images obtained from 9 human subjects, with over 180,000 frames for each modality. The mmWave-ocPID prototype employs a novel Neural Network integrated with two augmentation strategies for learning. Our initial experimental results show that mmWave-ocPID can achieve high identification accuracy, even when most of the human body of an individual is occluded in a controlled environment.},

abstract = {LoRa technology enables low power long range communication thanks to its modulation scheme, the 'Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)'. However, it is extremely susceptible and vulnerable to chirp collisions. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel modulation scheme, 'Frequency Hopped Chirp Spread Spectrum (FH-CSS)'. FH-CSS slices a chirp into several sub-chirps and places each to different frequency offsets. This enables demodulated signals of misaligned chirps to spread out in the frequency domain due to the characteristic of CSS. We implement FH-CSS on GNU Radio and compare its performance against standard CSS through real experiments on USRP B200 software defined radios. Preliminary results show that FH-CSS achieves around 90\% decoding success rate despite collision while standard CSS has less than 10\% on average.},

Securing edge-based systems with limited resources can be especially problematic due to challenges in adapting traditional network security protocols. In this work, we introduce two methods to provide security guarantees in resource-constrained devices-based ioT systems. As a case study, we propose an integration of Secure Swarm Toolkit (SST), an open-source framework for IoT security, with Lingua Franca (LF), a software platform for concurrent and time-sensitive applications. We report preliminary results on our work-in-progress implementation and experiments, followed by concrete future research plans.},

abstract = {Robust indoor positioning systems provide stable location-aware applications, enhancing our daily experiences. Fingerprint-based positioning techniques enable estimation of a user's position in complex indoor environments. While previous studies have used the received signal strength indicator or power spectral density as fingerprints, they typically achieved only submeter accuracy. This paper presents Geometric Sound Profile (GSP) as a novel location fingerprint to elevate the performance ceiling of fingerprint-based positioning. GSP is derived from the cross-correlation of transmitted and received signals based on transmission time, and a user's position is computed using weighted k-nearest neighbors. Our experiments demonstrate a median error of 0.66 m, marking a significant advancement over previous fingerprinting techniques.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a representative wireless technology for Internet of Things (IoT) that enables concurrent communication with multiple devices at low power. However, the connection establishment mechanism of BLE is susceptible to resource overlap problem among connected peripherals, leading to resource unfairness. To address problem and improve resource utilization, we propose a "Subrating-based Connection Scheduling (SCS)". It schedules and periodically manages connections by considering the service requirements of the connected devices. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that SCS achieves higher throughput and fairness compared to popular commercial BLE stacks while satisfying the requirements of peripherals.},

abstract = {In this paper, a displacement sensing method utilizing the bit-error characteristics in inter-chip wireless bus is presented. A non-contact displacement sensor is highly demanded in many engineering fields, and its miniaturization contributes to the expansion of further application areas and simplifies implementation. Inter-chip wireless bus is a short-range wireless communication technology that uses a small coupler, and its bit-error characteristics change according to the relative position between couplers. Additionally, the bit-error rate in inter-chip wireless bus can be obtained solely by digital processing through a tiny microcontroller. Therefore, a tiny digital displacement sensor, integrating a small coupler, wireless transceiver circuits, and a microcontroller, can be realized. The principle of proposed sensing method is verified using simulations, and a 1 mm \texttimes{} 1 mm CMOS LSI test chip is designed and fabricated using 180-nm CMOS technology.},

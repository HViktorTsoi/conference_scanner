  abstract={Radio map, serving as an eﬃcient indicator of wireless environments, has been widely used in smart-city applications, including network monitoring/planning, anomaly signal detection, and indoor/outdoor localization. It is hard to maintain an update-to-date fine-grained radio map within a large area, since the radio map changes rapidly due to the internal and external factors. Previous studies usually relied on time-consuming site surveys at densely predefined reference points, leading to either coarse-grained or out-of-date radio maps. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained radio map reconstruction framework, called Supreme, based on crowd-sourced data in an image super-resolution manner. Specifically, Supreme explores spatial-temporal relationships in historical coarse-grained radio maps and builds a real-time fine-grained radio map using deep spatial-temporal reconstruction networks. Furthermore, a heterogeneous data fusion module is devised to make full use of external information. To evaluate the performance of Supreme, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on a large-scale dataset with a total of six-month data collected from two university campuses. Besides, we investigate the transferability of Supreme in different locations and service networks, showing that the fine-tuned model can largely reduce the training time and achieve better performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and a case study on the localization is enhanced with marginal improvements on accuracy.},

  title={SateLoc: A Virtual Fingerprinting Approach to Outdoor LoRa Localization using Satellite Images}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={13-24},
  abstract={With the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and large-scale Location-Based Services (LBS), LoRa localization has been attractive due to its low cost, low power and long range properties. However, existing localization approaches based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) are either easily affected by signal fading of different land-cover types or labor-intensive. In this work, we propose SateLoc, a LoRa localization system that utilizes satellite images to generate virtual fingerprints. Specifically, SateLoc first uses high-resolution satellite images to identify land- cover types. With the path loss parameters of each land-cover type, SateLoc can automatically generate a virtual fingerprinting map for each gateway. We then propose a novel multi-gateway combination strategy, which is weighted by the environment interference of each gateway, to produce a joint likelihood distribution for localization. We implement SateLoc with commercial LoRa devices without any hardware modification, and evaluate its performance in a 227,500m2 urban area. Experimental results show that SateLoc achieves a median localization error of 47.1m, improving more than 40% compared to the state-of-the-art model-based approaches. More importantly, compared to the fingerprinting-based approach, SateLoc does not require the labor-intensive fingerprint acquisition process.},

  pages={37-48},
  abstract={Monitoring of physiology and behavior of marine animals living undisturbed in their natural habitats can provide valuable data on their well-being and response to environmental stressors. We focus on detection of feeding of predatory fish using implantable biologgers that record electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We propose a novel processing pipeline for resource-constrained embedded systems that can infer higher-level information, such as heart-rate and feeding events, from the ECG signals. Our main contribution is a lightweight change-detection algorithm, that can reliably detect fish feeding in noisy heart-rate data based on unique statistical properties of feeding-induced changes in heart-rate. We evaluate our approach using an in-house biologger that we surgically implant in twelve coral trouts over a period of ten weeks. We show that our signal processing pipeline performs well with noisy ECG signals overall. Specifically, our heart-rate estimation algorithm achieves errors of less than one beat per minute even in scenarios where popular algorithms used by domain scientists perform poorly. Furthermore, our feeding detection algorithm achieves good accuracy and matches the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring significantly less memory and computational resources. This work is an important first step towards long-term monitoring of high-level condition and health of marine animals in the wild.},

  abstract={We address the problem of human posture detection with casual loose-fitting smart garments by fabricating a new type of highly sensitive, stretchable, optical transparent and low-cost strain sensor enabled by uniquely designed microcracks within a hybrid conductive thin film. In terms of sensitivity and stretchability, the developed sensor outperformed most of the works reported in recent literature, and has a gauge factor of 103 at the high strain of 58%. By attaching these sensors to an off-the-self casual jacket, we implement E-Jacket, a smart loose-fitting sensing garment prototype. To detect postures from sensor data, we implement a conventional deep learning model, CNN-LSTM, capable of overcoming the noise induced by the loose-fitting of the sensors to the human skin. To evaluate E-Jacket, we conducted three case studies in experimental environments: recognition of daily activities, recognition of stationary postures with random hand movements, and slouch detection. Our evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed E-Jacket smart garment system for different posture recognition applications.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={61-72},
  abstract={In developing countries, majority of the households use overhead water tanks to have running water in their taps. These water tanks are exposed to the elements, which usually render the tap water uncomfortable to use, given the extreme subtropical weather conditions. Externally weatherproofing these tanks to maintain the groundwater temperature is short-lived, and only results in a marginal (0.5 −1 ◦C) improvement in tap water temperature. We propose Ashray, an IoT-inspired, intelligent system to minimize the exposure of water to the elements thereby maintaining its temperature close to that of the groundwater. Ashray learns the water demand patterns of a household and pumps water into the overhead tank only when necessary. The predictive, machine learning based, approach of Ashray improves water comfort by up to 8 ◦C in summers and 3 ◦C in winters, on average. Ashray is retrofitted into existing infrastructure with a hardware prototyping cost of $27, whereas it can save up to 16% on water heating costs, through reduction in natural gas consumption, by leveraging groundwater temperature. Our proposed system, Ashray, can positively impact the lives of millions of people in developing countries.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={73-84},
  abstract={Personal mobile sensing is fast permeating our daily lives to enable activity monitoring, healthcare and rehabilitation. Combined with deep learning, these applications have achieved significant success in recent years. Different from conventional cloud-based paradigms, running deep learning on devices offers several advantages including data privacy preservation and low-latency response for both model inference and update. Since data collection is costly in reality, Google’s Federated Learning offers not only complete data privacy but also better model robustness based on multiple user data. However, personal mobile sensing applications are mostly user-specific and highly affected by environment. As a result, continuous local changes may seriously affect the performance of a global model generated by Federated Learning. In addition, deploying Federated Learning on a local server, e.g., edge server, may quickly reach the bottleneck due to resource constraint and serious failure by attacks. Towards pushing deep learning on devices, we present MDLdroid, a novel decentralized mobile deep learning framework to enable resource-aware on-device collaborative learning for personal mobile sensing applications. To address resource limitation, we propose a ChainSGD-reduce approach which includes a novel chain-directed Synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to effectively reduce overhead among multiple devices. We also design an agent-based multi-goal reinforcement learning mechanism to balance resources in a fair and efficient manner. Our evaluations show that our model training on off-the-shelf mobile devices achieves 2x to 3.5x faster than single-device training, and 1.5x faster than the master-slave approach.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={85-96},
  abstract={As the proliferation of backscatter-based applications, exploiting backscatter-based sensing becomes more important. Due to the requirement of accurate estimation of backscatter channels (phase and amplitude), which is often distorted when multiple signals collide with each other, existing works are generally limited to either parallel decoding of collided signals or with non-collided signals only. Motivated by our observation that a channel can be distorted during collisions, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve channel properties of the respective tags, we propose the first approach to channel estimation of parallel 2backscattered signals, called Fireworks. We model the relationship between the channel and the signal moving trajectory in the In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) domain and implement this design in our lab. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate up to five channels in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2~4× improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

  year={2020},

  number={},
  pages={97-108},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT), which connects a large number of devices with wireless connectivity, has come into the spotlight. As the scope of IoT applications becomes wider, we observe a surge of missioncritical IoT services, e.g., industrial automation systems and medical IoT systems, requiring to satisfy stringent latency, reliability, and/or energy efficiency guarantees. For this purpose, a new MAC, called Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), has been standardized in IEEE 802.15.4e. However, it is challenging to design a distributed scheduling protocol that achieves the required QoS and energy efficiency at the same time due to complicated tradeoff (providing enough number of slots for QoS vs. minimizing scheduled slots for energy efficiency). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for providing QoS, called SSAP, which is designed to maximize network lifetime in a distributed fashion while satisfying given reliability and latency requirements. To this end, we decompose our goal into two crucial design components: (i) scheduling of slot and channel, and (ii) control of medium access period, each of which is performed by low-complexity and distributed mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to comprehensively handle multiple QoSes for TSCH-based IoT networks. We implement SSAP in Contiki OS and perform extensive simulations and real experiments under various scenarios. Our evaluation results demonstrate that SSAP satisfies highly reliable communication and latency requirements while having the network lifetime that is 1.6 times longer compared to existing protocols for TSCH.},

  title={Robust Dynamic Hand Gesture Interaction using LTE Terminals}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={109-120},
  abstract={Device-free hand gesture is one of the most natural ways to interact with everyday objects. However, existing WiFi-based gesture recognition solutions are typically restricted to indoor environments due to limited outdoor coverage. Furthermore, to achieve high sampling rates, they may interfere with normal data transmissions. In this paper, we aim to develop a robust dynamic gesture interaction system that can be ubiquitously deployed using Long-term Evolution (LTE) mobile terminals. Through both empirical studies and in-depth analysis using the Fresnel zone model, we reveal the key factors that contribute to the repeatability and discernibility of gestures. We show that the optimal location and orientation to perform gestures indeed exist and can be identified without prior knowledge of the position of LTE base stations (BSs) relative to a terminal. Guided by the design principles derived from Fresnel zone characteristics around a 4G terminal, we design highly repeatable and discernible gestures with salient received signal profiles. A gesture interaction system has been developed and implemented to achieve robust recognition with this careful design. Extensive experiments have been conducted in both indoor and outdoor environments, for different relative placements of mobile terminal and BS, and with different users. The proposed system can automatically identify the direction of BSs with a median error of less than 15 degrees and achieve gesture recognition accuracy as high as 98% in all scenarios without the need to acquire any training data.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={121-132},
  abstract={High accuracy and device-free indoor localization is still a holy grail to enable smart environments. With the growing privacy concerns and regulations, it is necessary to develop methods and systems that can be low-power, device-free as well as privacy-aware. While IR-based solutions fit the bill, they require many modules to be installed in the area of interest for higher accuracy, or proper planning during installation, or they may not work if the background has multiple heat-emitting objects, etc. In this paper, we propose a custom-built miniature device called LOCI that uses IR sensing. One unit of LOCI can provide three-dimensional localization at best. LOCI uses only a thermopile and a PIR sensor built within a 5x5x2 cm3 module. Since IR-based sensing is used, LOCI consumes around 80 mW. LOCI uses analog waveform from the PIR sensor with the gain of the PIR sensor dynamically controlled through software in real-time to simulate spatial diversity. LOCI proposes low-complexity techniques with sensor fusion to eliminate the noise in the background, which has not been handled in previous works even with sophisticated signal processing techniques. Since LOCI uses raw data from the thermopile, the computations are power-efficient. We present the complete design of LOCI and the proposed methodology to estimate height and location. LOCI achieves accuracies of sub-22 cm with a confidence of 0.5 and sub-35 cm with a confidence of 0.8. The best-case location accuracy is 12.5 cm. The accuracy of height estimation is within 8 cm in majority cases. LOCI can easily be extended to recognize activities.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={133-144},
  abstract={Generating maps of indoor environments beyond the line of sight finds applications in several areas such as planning, navigation, and security. While researchers have previously explored the use of RF signals to generate maps, prior work has two important limitations: (i) it requires moving the mapping setup along the entire lengths of the sides of the building, and (ii) it generates maps that are not fully connected, rather are scatter plots of locations from where some obstacles reflected the signals. Thus, prior approaches require human interpretation to locate the walls and determine how they merge. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose RFMap, which generates fully connected maps, and does not require the measurement setup to be moved along the sides of the buildings. To generate the map, RFMap first transmits RF signals in many different directions by rotating the antennas while keeping them at the same location and then measures the distances of different reflectors inside the building. Next, it identifies these reflectors and classifies them into various types based on the properties of the reflections. A key challenge is that RFMap does not receive reflections from all the directions due to the specular nature of the reflectors. Due to this, it only gets sparse data about the objects in the environment. To address this challenge, RFMap trains deep generative adversarial network (GAN) to intelligently predict the missing information. At runtime, it feeds the locations and types of the detected reflectors to the trained GAN and generates the complete and accurate map. We implemented RFMap using software defined radios and extensively evaluated it in several real world environments. Our results show that RFMap generated the maps of all the buildings that we tested it on with high accuracy.},

  abstract={We present a precise and robust GPS spoofing mitigation method, which is based on a position likelihood distribution. Compared to existing spoofing mitigation methods, this maximum likelihood method is less prone to selecting the wrong satellite signals when (spoofed) duplicates are received. The presented method operates from GPS signal snapshots as short as one millisecond and detects all likely receiver positions. Even with spoofing signals stronger than the authentic satellite signals, the actual receiver position is still found through iterative dampening of the strongest signals. The spoofing mitigation capability is evaluated on the de facto standard TEXBAT spoofing dataset. We reach median position errors introduced by spoofing below 19 m and keep the maximum error below 222 m for all TEXBAT scenarios. This is six times more accurate than the best previous work, which only detects spoofing attacks, but does not mitigate them.},

We propose new centralized and decentralized schemes to process the sparse and noisy wireless data, and leverage graph-based clustering techniques for group detection from short-term and long-term aspects. Group-In provides two outcomes: 1) group detection in short time intervals such as two minutes and 2) long-term linkages such as a month. To verify the performance, we conduct two experimental studies. One consists of 27 controlled scenarios in the lab environments. The other is a real-world scenario where we place Bluetooth scanners in an office environment, and employees carry beacons for more than one month. Both the controlled and real-world experiments result in high accuracy group detection in short time intervals and sampling liberties in terms of the Jaccard index and pairwise similarity coefficient.},

  pages={169-180},
  abstract={New battery-free sensor tags that interoperate with unmodified standard IoT devices can extend a sensor network’s capabilities in a scalable and cost-effective manner. The tags achieve battery-free operation through backscatter-related techniques, while the standard IoT devices can provide the necessary unmodulated carrier, avoiding additional dedicated infrastructure. However, this approach presents multiple challenges: It requires coordination between nodes transmitting, receiving and generating carrier, adds extra latency and energy consumption to already constrained devices, and increases interference and contention in shared spectrum. We present TagAlong, a medium access mechanism for interoperable sensor tags that, besides coordinating, optimizes the use of carrier generators, minimizing the disruption caused to the operation of the regular nodes. We accomplish this by parallelizing communications with battery-free tags when possible, sharing carriers for multiple tags concurrently and synchronizing communications with tags that share carrier generators. We demonstrate the feasibility of TagAlong in a testbed deployment. In our evaluation we find that it can reduce the duration of the tags’ schedule by 60% while improving the energy and spectrum usage by 30% when compared to sequential interrogation with no difference in reliability.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={181-192},
  abstract={The main obstacles to achieve truly ubiquitous sensing are (i) the limitations of battery technology - batteries are short-lived, hazardous, bulky, and costly - and (ii) the unpredictability of ambient power. The latter causes sensors to operate intermittently, violating the availability requirements of many real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Coalesced Intermittent Sensor (CIS), an intermittently-powered "sensor" that senses continuously! Although a single node will frequently be off charging, a group of nodes can –in principle– sense 24/7 provided that their awake times are spread apart. As communication is too expensive, we rely on inherent component variations that induce small differences in power cycles. This basic assumption has been verified through measurements of different nodes and power sources. However, desynchronizing nodes is not enough. An important finding is that a CIS designed for certain (minimal) energy conditions will become synchronized when the available energy exceeds the design point. Nodes employing a sleep mode (to extend their availability) do wake up collectively at some event, process it, and return to charging as the remaining energy is typically too low to handle another event. This results in multiple responses (bad) and missing subsequent events (worse) due to the synchronized charging. To counter this undesired behavior we designed an algorithm to estimate the number of active neighbors and respond proportionally to an event. We show that when intermittent nodes randomize their responses to events, in favorable energy conditions, the CIS reduces the duplicated captured events by 50% and increases the percentage of capturing entire bursts above 85%.},

  pages={193-204},
  abstract={Smart cities, utilities, third-parties, and government agencies are having pressure on managing stochastic power generation from distributed rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, such as predicting and reacting to the variations in electric grid. Recently, there is a rising interest to identify solar PV arrays automatically and passively. Traditional approaches such as online assessment and utilities interconnection filings are time consuming and costly, and limited in geospatial resolution, and thus do not scale up to every location. Significant recent work focuses on using aerial imagery to train machine learning or deep learning models to automatically detect solar PV arrays. Unfortunately, these approaches typically require Very High Resolution (VHR) images and human handcrafted solar PV array templates for training, which have a minimum cost of $15 per km2 and are not always available at every location.To address the problem, we design a new system—SolarFinder that can automatically detect distributed solar PV arrays in a given geospatial region without any extra cost. SolarFinder first automatically fetches regular resolution satellite images within the region using publicly-available imagery APIs. Then, SolarFinder leverages multi-dimensional K-means algorithm to automatically segment solar arrays on rooftop images. Eventually, SolarFinder employs hybrid linear regression approach that integrates support vector machine (SVM) modeling with a deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) approach to accurately identify solar PV arrays and characterize each solar deployment. We evaluate SolarFinder using 269,632 satellite images that include 1,143,636 contours from 13 geospatial regions in U.S. We find that pre-trained SolarFinder yields a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.17, which is 3 times better than the most recent pre-trained CNNs approach and the same as a re-trained CNNs approach.},

  year={2020},

  pages={205-216},
  abstract={We address the problem of localizing multiple intruders (unauthorized transmitters) using a distributed set of sensors in the context of a shared spectrum system. In contrast to single transmitter localization, multiple transmitter localization (MTL) has not been thoroughly studied. In shared spectrum systems, it is important to be able to localize simultaneously present multiple intruders to effectively protect a shared spectrum from malware-based, jamming, or other multi-device unauthorized-usage attacks. The key challenge in solving the MTL problem comes from the need to "separate" an aggregated signal received from multiple intruders into separate signals from individual intruders. Furthermore, in a shared spectrum paradigm, presence of an evolving set of authorized users (e.g., primary and secondary users) adds to the challenge.In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the MTL problem based on the hypothesis-based Bayesian approach called MAP. Direct application of the MAP approach to the MTL problem incurs prohibitive computational and training cost. In this work, we develop optimized techniques based on MAP with significantly improved computational and training costs. In particular, we develop a novel interpolation method, ILDW, which helps minimize the training cost. We generalize our techniques via online-learning to the setting wherein there may be a set of dynamically-changing authorized users present in the background. We evaluate our developed techniques on large-scale simulations as well as on small-scale indoor and outdoor testbeds. Our experiments demonstrate that our technique outperforms the prior approaches by significant margins, i.e., error up to 74% less in large-scale simulations and 30% less in real-world testbeds.},

  abstract={Pure electric vehicles (EVs) are more and more popular in current automotive markets. Many services for EVs such as intelligent battery charging systems and mobile apps are developed to monitor battery energy information (energy consumption time series) for users. However, it is neglected that such EV energy consumption time series may lead to driver privacy related problems such as the disclosure of driving path. In this paper, we propose the first battery energy based path inference attacks (Bepath), which can estimate EV driving paths only based on EV energy consumption time series. Bepath firstly estimates appliance states of an EV including vehicle speed state, air condition state and intersection turn state based on EV energy consumption time series. And then, Bepath figures out the driving path based on the estimated appliance states and map information. We used real-life daily driving data with different participants to test the performance of Bepath and compared inferred path results between Bepath and an existing method to evaluate the path inference accuracy of Bepath. The experimental results show that Bepath can estimate appliance states accurately and infers 50% trips with distance errors within 0.5 km, while the previous work that infers paths based on vehicle speed from insurance companies can only infer 26% trips with distance errors within 0.5 km.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={229-240},
  abstract={Many usage-based automotive insurance programs do not directly use any GPS-based location tracking devices. Instead, CAN-bus data, such as brake signal data, can be collected by these programs to evaluate drivers’ driving habits and vehicle usage policies. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using a temporal sequence of applied brake signals collected from a vehicle, attackers can still possibly infer the vehicle’s route over the period, even though brake signal data does not reveal any specific location information. Our route inference is basically composed of three steps: At first, we categorize brake signal subsequences into four different driving maneuvers (i.e., stopping from a certain speed, reducing speed to adjust with the traffic flow, and taking left and right turns). Second, we estimate the number of intersections traversed by the vehicle using the applied brake signals and their corresponding maneuvers. Particularly, we also estimate the overall speed profile based on the magnitude and interval of different brake signals. From the estimated speed profile, we infer the distances, traveling time, and traffic signs corresponding to the candidate edges. Finally, we design a graph-based route-selection algorithm to find a list of (paths) routes from the regional map using the predicted driving maneuvers and the speed profile. We use a score function based on three factors (i.e., distance, traveling time, and traffic signs) to identify a candidate edge. We evaluate our approach using over 450km of transportation data, which has been collected from 24 individuals. The experimental results demonstrate that, by resorting to our solution, 89% of the original drivers’ trajectory can be successfully recovered from their brake data regardless of driver and vehicle models.},

  abstract={A key barrier to applying any smart technology to a building is the requirement of locating and connecting to the necessary resources among the thousands of sensing and control points, i.e., the metadata mapping problem. Existing solutions depend on exhaustive manual annotation of sensor metadata — a laborious, costly, and hardly scalable process. To reduce the amount of manual effort required, this paper presents a multi-oracle selective sampling framework to leverage noisy labels from information sources with unknown reliability such as existing buildings, which we refer to as weak oracles, for metadata mapping. This framework involves an interactive process, where a small set of sensor instances are progressively selected and labeled for it to learn how to aggregate the noisy labels as well as to predict sensor types.Two key challenges arise in designing the framework, namely, weak oracle reliability estimation and instance selection for querying. To address the first challenge, we develop a clustering-based approach for weak oracle reliability estimation to capitalize on the observation that weak oracles perform differently in different groups of instances. For the second challenge, we propose a disagreement-based query selection strategy to combine the potential effect of a labeled instance on both reducing classifier uncertainty and improving the quality of label aggregation. We evaluate our solution on a large collection of real-world building sensor data from 5 buildings with more than 11, 000 sensors of 18 different types. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of our solution, which outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.},

In this paper, we propose new partial similarity measures, categorized as time-sensitive, order-sensitive and order-insensitive ones, and show with real data that these partial similarity measures are more robust than classical measures and more suitable for generating meaningful query results in near-neighbor type of data mining applications. Further, the power of the partial similarity persists even with significant down-sampling. We presented rigorous analysis of the performance of partial similarity measures with subsampling. Our evaluation using real data shows high recall and precision (≥ 90%) with samples only in the order of 1% of the original data size.},

  abstract={Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of energy consumption in the US, accounting for more than 40% of US primary energy consumption. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) accounts for nearly 50% of that use. Conditioning buildings is important since people spend 87% of their time in the place they live (residential) and the place they work (commercial). Despite this massive expense, many users are dissatisfied with the thermal conditions in buildings. Savings made in HVAC systems, therefore, have a major impact on energy consumption and cost, together with the reduction of greenhouse emissions for the nation. Equally critical is to provide thermal quality of service to their users, so people are comfortable in the place they reside and work.In this paper, we explore the tradeoff between commercial building HVAC energy consumption and the quality of thermal conditioning provided to users. We argue that optimal HVAC control cannot be achieved due to lack of critical information, namely where the users are inside the building, what do they want with respect to thermal comfort and how each zone responds to thermal changes. In this work, we present OFFICE, a model predictive control (MPC) framework for smart building HVAC control. The framework has several components that help to address the current HVAC control systems shortcomings, including (a) occupancy sensing in real-time, (b) occupancy prediction models based on historical occupancy data, (c) human-in-the-loop comfort feedback, (d) data-driven thermodynamic building models, and (e) weather forecasting data. All these components provide the necessary input to our model predictive control optimization framework that minimizes monetary costs in energy use while maintaining quality comfort bounds for the building’s users based on real-time user’s feedback. We developed a large system that involves all the above components, replacing the Building Management System control algorithms, taking over full control of the HVAC system. We tested OFFICE in a real LEED Gold certified university building with over 20 workers performing their daily tasks for 4 weeks, and we showed that we could obtain monetary costs savings of more than 10% while at the same time reducing the users’ dissatisfaction levels with thermal comfort from 25% to 0% dissatisfaction, significantly improving the quality of thermal service provided to the building’s users.},

  abstract={Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WANs) are seeing wide-spread deployments connecting millions of sensors, each powered by a ten-year AA battery to radio infrastructure, often miles away. By design, iteratively querying all sensors in an LP-WAN may take several hours or even days, given the stringent battery limits of client radios. This precludes obtaining even an approximate real-time view of sensed information across LP-WAN devices over a large area, say in the event of a disaster, fault or simply for diagnostics.This paper presents QuAiL1, a system that provides a coarse aggregate view of sensed data across LP-WAN devices over a wide- area within a time span of just one LP-WAN packet. QuAiL achieves this by coordinating multiple LP-WAN radios to transmit their information synchronously in time and frequency despite their power constraints. We design each client’s transmission so that the base station can retrieve an approximate heatmap of sensed data by exploiting the spatial correlation of this data across clients. We further show how our system can be optimized for statistical and machine learning queries, all while maintaining the security and privacy of sensed data from individual clients. Our deployment over a 3 sq. km. LP-WAN deployment around CMU campus in Pittsburgh demonstrates a 4x faster information retrieval versus the state-of- the-art statistical methods to retrieve the spatial sensor heatmap at a desired resolution.},

  abstract={One of the major challenges faced by Augmented Reality (AR) systems is linking virtual content accurately on physical objects and locations. This problem is amplified for applications like mobile payment, device control or secure pairing that requires authentication. In this paper, we present an active LED tag system called GLITTER that uses a combination of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and modulated LEDs to anchor AR content with no a priori training or labeling of an environment. Unlike traditional optical markers that encode data spatially, each active optical marker encodes a tag’s identifier by blinking over time, improving both the tag density and range compared to AR tags and QR codes.We show that with a low-power BLE-enabled micro-controller and a single 5 mm LED, we are able to accurately link AR content from potentially hundreds of tags simultaneously on a standard mobile phone from as far as 30 meters. Expanding upon this, using active optical markers as a primitive, we show how a constellation of active optical markers can be used for full 3D pose estimation, which is required for many AR applications, using either a single LED on a planar surface or two or more arbitrarily positioned LEDs. Our design supports 108 unique codes in a single field of view with a detection latency of less than 400 ms even when held by hand.},

  abstract={Mobile Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays digital content on the real-world scenes surrounding a user, is bringing immersive interactive experiences where the real and virtual worlds are tightly coupled. To enable seamless and precise AR experiences, an image recognition system that can accurately recognize the object in the camera view with low system latency is required. However, due to the pervasiveness and severity of image distortions, an effective and robust image recognition solution for mobile AR is still elusive. In this paper, we present CollabAR, an edge-assisted system that provides distortion-tolerant image recognition for mobile AR with imperceptible system latency. CollabAR incorporates both distortion-tolerant and collaborative image recognition modules in its design. The former enables distortion-adaptive image recognition to improve the robustness against image distortions, while the latter exploits the ‘spatial-temporal’ correlation among mobile AR users to improve recognition accuracy. We implement CollabAR on four different commodity devices, and evaluate its performance on two multi-view image datasets. Our evaluation demonstrates that CollabAR achieves over 96% recognition accuracy for images with severe distortions, while reducing the end-to-end system latency to as low as 17.8ms for commodity mobile devices.},

  abstract={Estimates of road grade/slope can add another dimension of information to existing 2D digital road maps. Integration of road grade information will widen the scope of digital map’s applications, which is primarily used for navigation, by enabling driving safety and efficiency applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), eco-driving, etc. The huge scale and dynamic nature of road networks make sensing road grade a challenging task. Traditional methods oftentimes suffer from limited scalability and update frequency, as well as poor sensing accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a cost-effective and scalable road grade estimation framework using sensor data from smartphones. Based on our understanding of the error characteristics of smartphone sensors, we intelligently combine data from accelerometer, gyroscope and vehicle speed data from OBD-II/smartphone’s GPS to estimate road grade. To improve accuracy and robustness of the system, the estimations of road grade from multiple sources/vehicles are crowd-sourced to compensate for the effects of varying quality of sensor data from different sources. Extensive experimental evaluation on a test route of 9km demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method, achieving 5× improvement on road grade estimation accuracy over baselines, with 90% of errors below 0.3°.},

Moreover, no automated solutions exist for monitoring hand hygiene techniques, such as "how to hand rub" technique by WHO. In this work, we introduce RFWash; the first radio-based device-free system for monitoring Hand Hygiene (HH) technique. On the technical level, HH gestures are performed back-to-back in a continuous sequence and pose a significant challenge to conventional two-stage gesture detection and recognition approaches. We propose a deep model that can be trained on unsegmented naturally-performed HH gesture sequences. RFWash evaluation demonstrates promising results for tracking HH gestures, achieving gesture error rate of < 8% when trained on 10-second segments, which reduces manual labelling overhead by ≈ 67% compared to fully supervised approach. The work is a step towards practical RF sensing that can reliably operate inside future healthcare facilities.},

To solve this problem, we propose CamWeight, a novel vision-based weight inference system that takes video feed of off-the-shelf elastic mat (e.g., yoga mat) placed on the floor as the passenger walks over it while pulling his/her wheeled carry-on luggage. CamWeight makes use of inherent properties including amplitude and recovery time of strain, or mat deformation caused by footsteps and luggage wheels. Due to the inherent design of CamWeight, it incurs no additional time for weighing, while being cost effective. We present a preliminary proof-of-concept evaluation by varying weights in a luggage from 2.5 kg to 20 kg to achieve prediction mean absolute error of approximately 2 kg.},

Federated learning is an effective technique to avoid privacy infringement by involving multiple participants to collaboratively learn a shared model without revealing their local data. In this work, we evaluated federated learning for SER using a publicly available dataset. Our preliminary results show that speech emotion recognition can benefit from federated learning by not exporting sensitive user data to central servers, while achieving promising results compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract={The method is proposed to detect human body with frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Human detection is the first step before performing vital sign monitoring, which is one of the most important applications for mmWave radar. In this Abstract, we exploit the range profile (RP) variation within a certain distance to detect human. This requires less computational storage spaces than conventional approaches. First, we perform clutter removal processing to weak ranging signals, and then calculate the standard deviation of each chirp to identify whether there is human in radar’s field of view (Fov). The experimental results confirmed that the accuracy our proposed method is higher than 97% even if the received ranging signals are weak.},

WiFi networks are more prone to such side-channel attacks since any attacker within the network’s range can passively eavesdrop the channel. With the increasing number of smart home devices and sensors connecting to private WiFi networks, it is essential to understand the inadvertent information leakage through WiFi side-channels.

  abstract={As pollution problems become increasingly prominent nowadays, urban air quality monitoring has attracted more and more attention. In recent years, sensing systems based on low-cost sensors are proposed to achieve fine-grained monitoring with larger amount of deployment as supplyment to conventional monitoring stations. Calibration is critical to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of these sensing systems to fight against sensor drift. While conventional field calibration approaches often rely on real-time data from a nearby standard station, they are not applicable to low-cost sensors which cannot receive the latest reference data from nearby stations after deployment. In reality, it is very difficult for sensors to get access to nearby standard stations deployed sparsely. To reduce the dependency on real-time and nearby reference data, we present a Robust Calibration approach based on Historical data (RCH) for the low-cost air pollution sensor calibration. Our method corrects the sensor drift by adapting sensitivity and offset based on estimating the probability distribution of pollutant's concentration. Experiments with real-world NO2 data in Foshan, China show that our proposed method acheives close performance to conventional field calibration methods but addresses above challenges. Moreover, our method can use historical data collected from the sensors in more distant geographic locations than the compared method.},

  abstract={Recent work has shown that two wearable devices worn on the same user can exploit gait as a secret source to generate a common key for secure pairing. The main threat of using gait comes from side-channel attackers who can use cameras to record the walking user and extract accelerations from the video to pair with legitimate devices. We propose a novel pre-step that uses a CNN-LSTM deep learning model to classify the acceleration measurement devices, i.e., between IMU vs. Camera. We prototype the pre-step and evaluate it using real subjects. Our results show that the proposed pre-step can achieve high classification success rates. The experiments with different cut-off frequencies show that the higher acceleration frequencies appear to contain more distinguishable features to classify camera from IMU.},

Many smart buildings require occupant detection in order to provide personalized services. Some examples include optimized energy usage and security. Several methods currently exist for occupant detection, each with their own drawbacks, such as installation requirements. Structural vibration sensing overcomes many of these drawbacks by measuring impulses created by occupants to infer their movements, but cannot detect stationary occupants. The ASOD utilizes active vibration sources, which inject acoustic waves into the structure then measure how the structure responds to them. Any occupants present interact with these waves, causing changes to the measured signal. By characterizing the changes in how the waves travel, we can predict the presence or lack of an occupant with up to a 97.7% accuracy, as demonstrated by experiments in a real- world environment.},

However, low and unpredictable availability of ambient energy combined with limited energy storage capacity of the devices make eﬃcient communication challenging. As a stepping stone toward addressing this challenge, we propose to leverage common patterns in harvested energy across the devices. In this abstract, we explore one possible approach that exploits a property of many fluorescent light sources used worldwide: their brightness changes with double the power line frequency. We design a circuit that transforms the corresponding changes in energy harvested with a solar panel into a digital signal that is frequency- and phase-synchronized across multiple devices. Based on our design, we build a novel batteryless node, called Flync. Using two Flync nodes, we demonstrate that the synchronized signal can be generated with less than 1 µA and a maximum measured node to node jitter of 363.24 µs.},

We seek to address some of these obstacles by designing a low-cost soil moisture sensing system that uses a hybrid approach of pairing completely wireless backscatter tags with a mobile reader.(p)(/p)We designed and built a backscatter tag prototype and tested our system both in laboratory and in situ at an organic farm field.

  abstract={IoT networks continue to expand in various domains, from smart homes and campuses to smart cities and critical infrastructures. Due to the lack of appropriate security measures embedded in IoT devices, they are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Existing machine learning-based methods for monitoring and securing IoT networks are fragile, expensive, and inflexible, and hence unable to cost-effectively cope with the dynamic and complex nature of attacks. For my PhD thesis, the aim is to develop a robust, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective network monitoring solution for securing large IoT systems. To do so, we would require to dynamically measure and analyze certain portions of network traffic. Therefore, we employ programmable networking techniques to dynamically and selectively acquire necessary telemetry data (packets and/or flows of connected devices) fed to a collection of learning-based models (each specialized in certain protocols with specific granularity) to classify devices, monitor their activity, and detect malicious behaviors. Our preliminary results show that the signature analysis of selected signaling packets from 26 real IoT devices yields a reasonably accurate inference by progressively collecting telemetry data at manageable processing costs.},

The harvested energy signal contains embedded information about the underlying physical conditions and thus can be used to detect activities in various applications. In this study, we implement Kinetic Energy Harvesters (KEHs) as context sensors and source of energy simultaneously, to detect the underlying activity and to power sensor nodes in IoT.

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices are almost everywhere around us, whether you are aware of them or not. Although the devices are usually tiny, due to the considerable amount, they store and send enormous data, many of which are critical. That high-value information, together with impoverished computation power, resulting in the weak security methods, makes IoT devices the ideal targets for attackers.Taking the advantages of reciprocity and randomness of wireless fading channels, key generation via physical layer is attracting more attention. It becomes a remarkable solution for wireless IoT communication in recent years. However, the feasibility under long range and low data rate scenarios of narrow band low power wide area network (LPWAN) lacks proper studies.To address the above issue, I propose to develop a novel key generation architecture that can apply to IoT communications especially under low power wide area scenarios. The system should also be resilient to various kinds of attacks that may be applied to the IoT devices. Finally, the proposed method will be implemented on devices and validated on practical application scenarios.},

Recent successful deployments of low-power wide-area networks (LP-WANs) render them the leading candidate enabling such connectivity. Yet, while LP-WAN clients achieve optimum performance in rural areas, they severely underperform in urban cities due to interference, worse multipath and noise. This significantly lowers their battery lives, range and data rates. This is further exacerbated by the fact that these low-power clients are also highly susceptible to security threats from much more powerful malicious adversaries.},

  abstract={The recent development of extremely low-power computing devices and efficient energy harvesters led to the creation of computing systems that are powered by intermittently available harvested energy, e.g., solar, piezoelectric, and radio-frequency (RF). Such computing systems go through power-on and off phases due to the lack of adequate harvesting energy. These systems are known as Intermittent Computing Systems. While existing works on intermittent computing systems concentrate preliminary on the lower level goals, e.g., execution progress and memory consistency [1], [3], [5], [6], [9], the potential of such systems under timing constraints is yet to be explored. Some applications of intermittent systems with timing constraints include monitoring wildlife, health, infrastructure and environmental conditions, pedestrian safety, indoor localization and occupancy detection. In this work, we schedule tasks on intermittent systems where tasks may have timing constraints. We focus on the timely-response of intermittent systems by (1) developing unified frameworks that integrate harvesting and real-time systems, and (2) engineering machine learning algorithms for timely execution of the important portion of a task via imprecise scheduling.},

Our approach has two major pipelines, translation pipeline which translates from novel configuration to a reference configuration and an inference pipeline which classifies the activities performed by the user. We further expect to extend this model to more complex multi user interacting sensing environments and to In-Situ setups.},

  abstract={The construction industry has stayed behind the curve in regards to adoption and integration of new technologies. This is emphasised with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its ability to create digital environments. The industry is now beginning to integrate IoT devices and digitalise its manual processes. This research project focuses on how blockchain along with IoT devices can be used to reduce uncertainty in data coming from a construction site. The design of a framework to store, process and share this data effectively with all relevant stakeholders in a construction project is also discussed.},

  abstract={Today’s deep neural networks require substantial computation resources for their training, storage, and inference, which limits their effective use on resource-constrained devices. Many recent research activities explore different options for compressing and optimizing deep models for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our work so far has focused on two important aspects of deep neural network compression: class-dependent model compression and explainable compression. We shortly summarize our contributions and conclude with an outline of our future research directions.},

  abstract={As the most widely used outdoor navigation system, GPS can provide accurate localization on the horizontal plane. However, the vertical localization accuracy exhibits a poor performance. Vehicles on the elevated road usually receive wrong navigation instructions since GPS fails to detect vehicles' vertical location. In this paper, we present a vertical location system named VLD for vehicles in metropolises mainly leveraging smartphones' barometers, a low-power sensor found in an increasing number of smart devices. When initially on the ground, VLD combines the height and angle detection algorithms to confirm the vertical location with low complexity. Once vehicles have exited the ground and start to travel on the elevated road, a pressure-height model trained by a novel proposed sensor fusion algorithm is activated to measure vehicles' relative height. Then, it tracks the relative height in real time according to a pressure-temperature model which is calibrated by current weather. Comparing the relative height with the single-level elevated road's height, VLD can determine which level vehicles travel on in many highway interchanges and when they exit the elevated road. Experiments covering one month demonstrate that the detection accuracy of VLD exceeds 99% under different weather conditions, and it shows a more accurate relative height measurement compared to available literature, including Baidu Maps and one barometer based application-Altitude. Finally, VLD demonstrates a high efficiency with respect to both the detection delay and power consumption.},

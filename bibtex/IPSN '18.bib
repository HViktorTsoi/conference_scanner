abstract = {Lawns, also known as turf, cover an estimated 128,000km2 [9] in North America alone, with landscape requirements representing 30\% of freshwater consumed in the residential domain [27]. With this consumption comes a large amount of environmental, economic, and social incentive to make turf irrigation systems as efficient as possible. Recent work introduced the concept of distributed control in irrigation systems, but existing control strategies either do not take advantage of the distributed control, or don't revise the strategy over time in response to collected data. In this work, we introduce PICS, a data-driven control strategy that self-improves over time, adapts to the local specific conditions and weather changes, and requires virtually no human input in both setup and maintenance providing a plug-and-play system that requires minimal pre-deployment efforts. In addition to substantial improvements in ease-of-use, we find across 4 weeks of large-scale irrigation system deployment that PICS improves system efficiency by 12.0\% in comparison to industry best and 3.3\% in comparison to academic state-of-the-art. Despite using less water, PICS also was found to improve quality of service by a factor of 4.0x compared to industry best and 2.5x compared to academic state of the art.},

abstract = {Most digital maps are designed for vehicles and miss a great number of walkways that can facilitate people's daily mobility as pedestrians. Despite of such a fact, most existing map updating approaches only focus on the motorways. To fill the gap, this paper presents VitalAlley, a walkway discovery and verification approach with mobility data from large scale crowdsensing. VitalAlley aims to identify the uncharted walkways from the big but noisy personal mobility data and incorporate these findings into existing incomplete road maps. The implementation of VitalAlley faces the major challenges due to the unstructured nature of the walkways themselves and the noise from crowdsensing data. VitalAlley leverages different aspects of individual mobility to model and estimate the walkable areas, based on which representative walkways that connect known road segments or points of interest are extracted. To verify the new-found walkways, we further propose image based auto-verification with the help of publicly accessible street image database from Google Street View. VitalAlley is implemented and evaluated with real world crowdsensing data from the Singapore National Science Experiment. As a result, 736 walkways (totaling 161 km in distance) are identified from the mobility dataset collected from 108,337 students in Singapore. We manually verify 224 walkways totaling 32.4 km over a 9 km2 district through on-site inspection. The results suggest over 96\% accuracy of VitalAlley in discovering the walkways.},

abstract = {Up-to-date meteorological information about upper air conditions is crucial for accurate weather modeling and forecasting. Existing techniques to sense meteorological parameters in the atmosphere are costly and provide only limited temporal and spatial sensing resolutions. In this paper, we propose crowdsourcing air traffic control data as a new cost-efficient method to achieve a high temporal and spatial resolution, and large coverage. Our solution leverages Secondary Surveillance Radar Mode S and ADS-B transponder signals that are continuously transmitted by aircraft for air traffic control purposes. It builds on signals captured by the OpenSky Network, a global-scale sensor network crowdsourcing 15+ billions of transponder messages per day from aircraft up to an altitude of 13 km. Based on the decoded data, we infer meteorological conditions such as air temperature, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach is effective at estimating these parameters with high resolutions along the tracks of more than 50 percent of all aircraft monitored by the OpenSky Network. Our method delivers estimations for temperature with 0.11°C, wind speed with 0.09 m/s, wind direction with 1.00°, and air pressure with 0.10 hPa average deviation, making those measurements suitable for the assimilation in numerical weather models.},

This establishes a fundamental asymptotic limitation on the information diffusion capacity of such opportunistic mobile sensor networks --- the encounter patterns arising out of physical motions in a geometric space are not ideal for information diffusion.},

abstract = {Internet of Things has stringent requirements on the wireless network throughput for timely transmission of the big data being produced. In order to maximize the throughput over dynamic fluctuations of wireless channel quality, current wireless systems adapt the link rate to the instantaneous channel condition, but fail to fully utilize the channel capacity due to the discrete choices of available link rates and the gap between these rates. Instead, in this paper we present vMod, a lightweight and practical solution towards maximum wireless network throughput by redesigning the wireless link rates from discrete to continuous. The key idea of vMod is to modulate a fractional number of data bits into each symbol by employing the Variable-Length Code (VLC), which is able to statistically yield any link rate. We implemented vMod on software-defined radio platforms. Experiment results demonstrate that under highly dynamic wireless network conditions, vMod greatly improves the WiFi throughput by 30\% over a single narrowband link, but incurs only negligible overhead.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging wireless platform which can support battery-powered devices lasting 10-years while communicating at low data-rates to gateways several kilometers away. Not all such devices will experience the promised 10 year battery life despite the high density of LPWAN gateways expected in cities. Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain.This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3\texttimes{} in range and 4\texttimes{} in client battery-life.},

Our extensive evaluation in two large-scale testbed deployments (Indriya and Flocklab) shows that Codecast provides up to 4x the throughput of Chaos and 1.8x the throughput of LWB for many-to-many data communication.Finally, we demonstrate the utility of Codecast through a distributed channel selection mechanism and a link state based routing protocol.},

abstract = {Aperiodic data collection received little attention in wireless sensor networks, compared to its periodic counterpart.The recent Crystal system uses synchronous transmissions to support aperiodic traffic with near-perfect reliability, low latency, and ultra-low power consumption. However, its performance is known under mild interference---a concern, as Crystal relies heavily on the (noise-sensitive) capture effect and targets aperiodic traffic where "every packet counts".We exploit a 49-node indoor testbed where, in contrast to existing evaluations using only naturally present interference to evaluate synchronous systems, we rely on JamLab to generate noise patterns that are not only more disruptive and extensive, but also reproducible. We show that a properly configured, unmodified Crystal yields perfect reliability (unlike Glossy) in several noise scenarios, but cannot sustain extreme ones (e.g., an emulated microwave oven near the sink) that instead are handled by routing-based approaches. We extend Crystal with techniques known to mitigate interference---channel hopping and noise detection---and demonstrate that these allow Crystal to achieve performance akin to the original even under multiple sources of strong interference.},

abstract = {We specify and evaluate a new software-defined clock network architecture, Stitch. We use Stitch to derive all subsystem clocks from a single local oscillator (LO) on an embedded platform, and enable efficient radio frequency synchronization (RFS) between two nodes' LOs. RFS uses the complex baseband samples from a low-power low-cost narrowband transceiver to drive the frequency difference between the two devices to less than 3 parts per billion (ppb). Recognizing that the use of a wideband channel to measure clock frequency offset for synchronization purposes is inefficient, we propose to use a separate narrowband radio to provide these measurements. However, existing platforms do not provide the ability to unify the local oscillator across multiple subsystems. We demonstrate Stitch with a reference hardware implementation on a research platform. We show that, with Stitch and RFS, we are able to achieve dramatic efficiency gains in ultra-wideband (UWB) time synchronization and ranging. We demonstrate the same UWB ranging accuracy in state-of-the-art systems but with 59\% less utilization of the UWB channel.},

abstract = {Supplying the correct amount of vital nutrition at the correct time is the most fundamental and important requirement for the hospitalized patients. Among those treatments, saline therapy is the most important treatment many patients receive from the hospitals. It is a fact that, in almost all hospitals of Sri Lanka, an assistant or a nurse, among other assigned health care duties, are responsible for monitoring the saline supplied for each patient. Unfortunately, there are some critical situations, i.e., patient's blood refluxing back into the saline tubing system, patients had to experience because of the observers' mistake due to their busy schedules. Nonetheless, the traditional method of supplying saline is also proven not accurate because the saline drop rate for a patient has been adjusted by looking at the drops falling speed in the drip chamber. The proposed system facilitates a sophisticated method of controlling saline drop rate by monitoring the saline system remotely by using IoT.},

To this end, this paper proposes to the smarten Sri Lankan the train system by predicting the time a train reaches to its upcoming stations and sending the notifications to the subscribers about the arrival time to their stations. Subscribers then can reach their station whenever the train is reaching to the station or they can use any other means of transportation if the train is late.},

Inherent gravity is removed using a novel latency-free method using a gyroscope. The method has been tested on stand-alone MEMS sensor boards and multiple smart devices, in both phone and wrist-watch form factor with varied IMU sensor sets. Lengths up to 5 m have been measured with a mean measurement error of less than 3 cm. As a demo, we introduce EMeasure as an immensely useful and highly accurate length-measuring utility both on smartphones and smartwatches.},

abstract = {Ultrawideband (UWB) based localization has the potential to be used in a variety of applications due to its high accuracy. For robust and high performance in real environment, the most challenging issue is the detection and mitigation of noise from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Current researches use channel state information, particle or Kalman filter, and statistics based approaches for the NLOS noise detection and mitigation. These solutions show high accuracy in some applications; however, they need additional hardware and work in static environment only. We propose an NLOS mitigation algorithm that does not need any additional hardware and works in dynamic environment with mobile obstacles. The main idea of the algorithm are to estimate the NLOS bias by repetitively comparing the intersection of the hyperbolas with intersections of circles. The proposed approach is tested for Decawave UWB testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme works well in different dynamic scenarios as compared to the localization scheme without NLOS noise mitigation.},

abstract = {City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper insight into how our urban environments function. Applications such as observing air quality and measuring traffic flows can have powerful impacts, allowing city planners and citizen scientists alike to understand and improve their world. However, the path from conceiving applications to implementing them is fraught with difficulty. A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good idea and a realized one.The Signpost platform, presented at IPSN 2018, has been created to address these challenges. Signpost enables easy deployment by relying on harvested, solar energy and wireless networking rather than their wired counterparts. To further lower the bar to deploying applications, the platform provides the key resources necessary to support its pluggable sensor modules in their distributed sensing tasks. In this demo, we present the Signpost hardware and several applications running on a deployment of Signposts on UC Berkeley's campus, including distributed, energy-adaptive traffic monitoring and fine grained weather reporting.

abstract = {IoT localization systems based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology require dependable communication links to reliably acquire and efficiently share the timestamps in the network. The communication performance of UWB radios, however, is still largely unexplored and strongly affected by the employed physical layer settings. In this work, we analyze the role of different UWB physical layer settings and propose a scheme that adapts them at runtime in order to maintain a highly reliable link while minimizing energy consumption. The proposed adaptation scheme exploits the channel impulse response provided by the UWB transceiver to estimate the link quality and to extract information about the surrounding environment, such as the presence of destructive interference.},

To reach micro-power consumption, the architecture diverges from that of commodity receivers in the following ways: First, similar to backscatter transmitters, it offloads the power-hungry local oscillator to an external device. Second, we avoid the energy cost of demodulating a phase-modulated signal by treating 802.15.4 as a frequency-modulated one, allowing us to receive with a simple passive detector and an energy-efficient thresholding circuit. We demonstrate an off-the-shelf prototype of our receiver receives 802.15.4 from a distance of 470 cm with the carrier generator 30 cm away. This range is sufficient to integrate with deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We demonstrate this integration by pairing our receiver with a 802.15.4 backscatter transmitter and integrating it with unmodified commodity sensor nodes running the TSCH protocol.},

This system can be used in applications such as capturing and sharing 3D content in the social media, training people in different professions, and post-facto analysis of an event. This system uses off-the-shelf hardware and standard computer vision algorithms. Its novelty lies in the ability to optimally control camera data acquisition and processing stages to guarantee the desired quality of captured information and battery life. The design of the controller is based on extensive measurements and modeling of the relationships between the linear and angular motion of a camera and the quality of generated 3D point clouds as well as the battery life of the system. To achieve this, we 1) devise a new metric to quantify the quality of generated 3D point clouds, 2) formulate an optimization problem to find an optimal trigger point for the camera system and prolongs its battery life while maximizing the quality of captured 3D environment, and 3) make the model adaptive so that the system evolves and its performance improves over time.},

In order to provide all devices an accurate location in a common frame of reference, we utilize UWB nodes that range to the devices. To avoid the long startup time required to compute the device's orientation, we propose a novel technique that utilizes previously recorded magneticfield information to rapidly calibrate the compass. In order to simplify setup, we demonstrate automatic mapping of beacon locations and surveying of magnetic field by a pedestrian walking around the test area with a mobile device.},

For example, empty parking spot recommendation in a parking lot or promotion coupon notification of a shop at a shopping center should be delivered accordingly. This paper explores reliable push notification of content for novel interactive mobile applications over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure. Since mobile users move around with different speeds, this paper deals with such difference to relay right content in a reliable manner, called Reliable Push Notification (RPN).

Our receiver prototype achieves sufficient communication range to integrate with deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We illustrate this integration by pairing the prototype with an 802.15.4 backscatter transmitter and integrating it with unmodified 802.15.4 sensor nodes running the TSCH and Glossy protocols.},

abstract = {The Glimpse.3D is a body-worn camera that captures, processes, stores, and transmits 3D visual information of a real-world environment using a low cost camera-based sensor system that is constrained by its limited processing capability, storage, and battery life. The 3D content is viewed on a mobile device such as a smartphone or a virtual reality headset. This system can be used in applications such as capturing and sharing 3D content in the social media, training people in different professions, and post-facto analysis of an event. Glimpse.3D uses off-the-shelf hardware and standard computer vision algorithms. Its novelty lies in the ability to optimally control camera data acquisition and processing stages to guarantee the desired quality of captured information and battery life. The design of the controller is based on extensive measurements and modeling of the relationships between the linear and angular motion of a body-worn camera and the quality of generated 3D point clouds as well as the battery life of the system. To achieve this, we 1) devise a new metric to quantify the quality of generated 3D point clouds, 2) formulate an optimization problem to find an optimal trigger point for the camera system that prolongs its battery life while maximizing the quality of captured 3D environment, and 3) make the model adaptive so that the system evolves and its performance improves over time.},

abstract = {City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of our urban environments. However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good idea and a realized one. This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and experimentation for applications operating at city scale. To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing. Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints. We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its ability to support sensing applications. We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments, enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health.},

abstract = {A small variation in mobile hardware and software can potentially cause a significant heterogeneity or variation in the sensor data each device collects. For example, the microphone and accelerometer sensors on different devices can respond very differently to the same audio or motion phenomena. Other factors, like the instantaneous computational load on a smartphone, can cause key behavior like sensor sampling rates to fluctuate, further polluting the data. When sensing devices are deployed in unconstrained and real-world conditions, examples of sharply lower classification accuracy are observed due to what is collectively known as the sensing system heterogeneity. In this work, we take an unconventional approach and argue against solving individual forms of heterogeneity, e.g., improving OS behavior, or the quality/uniformity of components. Instead, we propose and build classifiers that themselves are more tolerant of these variations by leveraging deep learning and a data-augmented training process. Neither augmentation nor deep learning has previously been attempted to cope with sensor heterogeneity. We systematically investigate how these two machine learning methodologies can be adapted to solve such problems, and identify when and where they are able to be successful. We find that our proposed approach is able to reduce classifier errors on an average by 9\% and 17\% for a range of inertial- and audio-based mobile classification tasks.},

Despite the fact that dedicated hardware is nowadays subject of research and effective solutions exist, we envision a future where deep learning solutions -here Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)- are mostly executed by low-cost off-the shelf embedded platforms already available in the market.This paper moves in this direction and aims at filling the gap between CNNs and embedded systems by introducing a methodology for the design and porting of CNNs to limited in resources embedded systems. In order to achieve this goal we employ approximate computing techniques to reduce the computational load and memory occupation of the deep learning architecture by compromising accuracy with memory and computation.The proposed methodology has been validated on two well-know CNNs, i.e., AlexNet and VGG-16, applied to an image-recognition application and ported to two relevant off-the-shelf embedded platforms.},

abstract = {Student enrollments world-wide are increasing each year, while lecture attendance continues to fall, due to diverse demands on student time and easy access to online content. The resulting under-utilization of classrooms entails cost penalties, especially in campuses where real-estate is at a premium. This paper outlines our efforts to instrument a University campus with sensors to measure classroom attendance, in a cost-effective and scalable manner without endangering student privacy. We begin by undertaking a lab evaluation of several approaches to measuring class occupancy, and compare them in terms of cost, accuracy, and ease of deployment and operation. We then instrument 9 lecture halls of varying capacity across campus, collect and clean live data on occupancy spanning about 250 courses over 12 weeks during session, and draw insights into attendance patterns, including identification of canceled lectures and class tests; our occupancy data is released openly to the public. Lastly, we show how classroom allocation can be optimized based on attendance rather than enrollments, resulting in potential savings of 52\% in room costs.},

abstract = {Detecting objects that are carried when someone enters or exits a room is very useful for a wide range of smart building applications including safety, security, and energy efficiency. While there has been a significant amount of work on object recognition using large-scale RGB image datasets, RGB cameras are too privacy invasive in many smart building applications and they work poorly in the dark. Additionally, deep object detection networks require powerful and expensive GPUs. We propose a novel system that we call ODDS (Object Detector using a Depth Sensor) that can detect objects in real-time using only raw depth data on an embedded GPU, e.g., NVIDIA Jetson TX1. Hence, our solution is significantly less privacy invasive (even if the sensor is compromised) and less expensive, while maintaining a comparable accuracy with state of the art solutions. Specifically, we resort to training a deep convolutional neural network using raw depth images, with curriculum based learning to improve accuracy by considering the complexity and imbalance in object classes and developing a sparse coding based technique that speeds up the system ~2x with minimal loss of accuracy. Based on a complete implementation and real-world evaluation, we see ODDS achieve 80.14\% mean average precision in object detection in real-time (5--6 FPS) on a Jetson TX1.},

abstract = {Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of milliwatts during operation. Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to narrowband systems with low localization resolution. The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3 dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device can only reflect the power it receives. The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the initially imperceptible signal out of the noise. This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones. With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt, decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites the localization of every thing. To evaluate this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30 cm.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of all the signal paths arriving at a receiver array using only the corresponding received signal magnitude measurements (or, equivalently, the received power measurements). Typical AoA estimation techniques require phase information, which is not available in some WiFi/Bluetooth receivers, and is further challenging to properly measure in a synthetic antenna array due to synchronization issues. In this paper, we then show that AoA estimation is possible with only the received signal magnitude measurements. More specifically, we first propose a framework, based on the spatial correlation of the received signal magnitude, to estimate the AoA of signal paths from fixed signal sources (both active transmitters and passive objects). Next, we extend our AoA estimation framework to a dual setting, and further utilize a particle filter, to show how a moving target (both active transmitters and passive robots/humans) can be tracked, based on only the received signal magnitude measurements of a small number of fixed receivers. We extensively validate our proposed framework with several experiments (total of 22), in both closed and open areas. More specifically, we first utilize a robot to emulate an antenna array, and estimate the AoA of active transmitters, as well as passive objects using only the received WiFi signal magnitude measurements. We next validate our tracking framework by using only three off-the-shelf WiFi devices as receivers, to track an active transmitter, a passive robot that writes the letters of IPSN on its path, and a walking human. Overall, our results show that AoA can be estimated, with a high accuracy, with only the received signal magnitude measurements, and can be utilized for high quality angular localization and tracking.},

Yet, existing architectures consider the different localization technologies as monolithic entities and choose the final navigation position from the RAT that is expected to provide the highest accuracy. In contrast, we propose to fuse timing range measurements of diverse radio technologies in order to circumvent the limitations of the individual radio access technologies. We take a first step in this direction and propose to fuse timing measurements of satellite navigation systems and WiFi networks. We introduce different novel methods such as a data fuser, an estimator of WiFi ToF distance and a geometrical-statistical approach to best fuse the set of ranges in presence of a rich set of measurements. Experimental results show that our solution allows the mobile device to efficiently position itself in diverse challenging scenarios.},

abstract = {Indoor localization systems typically determine a position using either ranging measurements, inertial sensors, environmental-specific signatures or some combination of all of these methods. Given a floor plan, inertial and signature-based systems can converge on accurate locations by slowly pruning away inconsistent states as a user walks through the space. In contrast, range-based systems are capable of instantly acquiring locations, but they rely on densely deployed beacons and suffer from inaccurate range measurements given non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. In order to get the best of both worlds, we present an approach that systematically exploits the geometry information derived from building floor plans to directly improve location acquisition in range-based systems. Our solving approach can disambiguate multiple feasible locations taking into account a mix of LOS and NLOS hypotheses to accurately localize with significantly fewer beacons.We demonstrate our geometry-aware solving approach using a new ultrasonic beacon platform that is able to perform direct time-of-flight ranges on commodity smartphones. The platform uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for time synchronization and ultrasound for measuring propagation distance. We evaluate our system's accuracy with multiple deployments in a university campus and show that our approach shifts the 80\% accuracy point from 4 -- 8m to 1m as compared to solvers that do not use the floor plan information. We are able to detect and remove NLOS signals with 91.5\% accuracy.},

When tracking a target whose orientation changes, those approaches suffer from serious accuracy degradation. In order to achieve target tracking with pervasive applicability in various scenarios, we in this paper propose OmniTrack, an orientation-aware RFID tracking approach. Our study discovers the linear relationship between the tag orientation and the phase change of the backscattered signals. Based on this finding, we propose an orientation-aware phase model to explicitly quantify the respective impact of the read-tag distance and the tag's orientation. OmniTrack addresses practical challenges in tracking the location and orientation of a mobile tag. Our experimental results demonstrate that OmniTrack achieves centimeter-level location accuracy and has significant advantages in tracking targets with varing orientations, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

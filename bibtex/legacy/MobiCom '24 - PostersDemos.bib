abstract = {Accurate tracking of hand and object poses is essential for immersive XR applications. However, existing methods often struggle with the stringent requirements of XR environments. We present XRMan, a real-time hand-object pose tracking system designed for in-the-wild scenarios. XRMan uses a drift monitoring module for consistent accuracy, while farthest-point sampling and collider-based optimization streamline iterative optimization and reduce latency. Our system reduces end-to-end latency by 38.9\% compared to the baseline, with further improvements expected from the collider-based post-optimization module.},

abstract = {The real-time control capability of IoT devices is contingent upon the transmission of packets. However, due to the influence of multiple devices accessing the network, the bandwidth available to IoT devices from access points may decline significantly, which causes a surge in the queuing latency and interrupts the transmission. This phenomenon is referred to as transient congestion. To achieve stable high-quality network service, this paper designs RushWay, a QUIC-enabled framework for alleviating transient congestion. RushWay employs stream multiplexing to compress the original packet into the stream frame, thereby reducing the bandwidth required for transmission. Furthermore, RushWay employs an adaptive decision-making algorithm to assess uplink queue conditions and packet latency requirements, thereby alleviating transient congestion. The simulation results demonstrate that RushWay can improve key performance by 13\% to 94\%.},

abstract = {Cellular service providers (CSPs) require predicting the network performance for various reasons such as analyzing the impact of planned configuration changes and large-scale events on the network. Although network configurations are widely considered as key predictors of performance, we claim that they are insufficient for accurately predicting cellular network performance. The cellular networks are impacted by unmeasured external factors (e.g., weather, called latents), therefore, the performance prediction based solely on configurations may result in confounding effects. We show that the Mobility, Access, and Traffic (MAT) metrics should be considered in addition as network performance predictors. Using a large dataset collected from a live cellular network, we validate the claim and show the benefit of using MAT metrics for accurate performance prediction.},

abstract = {With the open radio access network (O-RAN) movement driving the evolution of cellular networks towards 6G, real time (RT) RAN control and assurance has emerged as the next frontier in RAN programmability, with in-base station (BS) machine learning (ML) at its core. However, scalability demands associated with production-grade networks necessitate the need for a robust, yet lightweight in-BS ML operations framework to support automated ML workflows. To that end, this paper introduces TinyRIC-ML, a novel lightweight and high-performance ML platform for RT operations within the RAN.

abstract = {The 5G network promised transformative services across various industries, yet its integration has mostly been limited to existing 4G services like IMS-based multimedia and IoT. This paper identifies two key reasons for this underutilization: first, the stringent, multi-dimensional requirements of next-generation verticals like AR/VR, mobile gaming, and robotics, and the limitations of traditional Quality of Service (QoS) approaches in meeting these needs. We argue for a shift towards Quality of Experience (QoE), which better captures user perception and instantaneous application state. To meet stringent QoE demands and optimize network utilization, we emphasize the importance of application state and context awareness within the network. As a solution, we propose AppNet, a novel framework that integrates application awareness into the networking stack via RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) of the Open-RAN platform, enabling dynamic QoS adjustments based on application context. This paper highlights 5G private networks as an ideal testing ground, focusing on multi-user scenarios to deliver optimal real-time interactive services at scale.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication is well-suited for agriculture, forest sensing, and environmental monitoring due to its low power and maintenance requirements. It can support a range of applications, including reading sensor values such as soil moisture or nutrient levels, monitoring plant health, tracking animal movements, or detecting forest fires. In these settings, sensors and backscatter nodes are often placed deep in the forest or under the plant canopy, while the reader is positioned on a mobile node such as a drone flying above the canopy. Consequently, signal attenuation caused by canopy blockage remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the feasibility of using backscatter communication in such environments and argues that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not the most reliable metric for evaluating link quality. Instead, we propose a new metric, called template correlation, which provides a more accurate assessment in low-SNR conditions. Our findings demonstrate that backscatter communication, with its low power consumption and minimalist hardware design at the tags, is effective for environmental monitoring, even in the presence of canopy attenuators like grasses or crops.},

abstract = {A crucial step for reducing emissions in the transport sector is the shift towards public transportation and bicycling. However, due to the lack of perceived safety, people are reluctant to commute by bicycle. A potential solution to this problem could be group cycling, allowing cyclists to form a group with others in order to ride together. Depending on local traffic laws, such groups allow for cycling next to each other and for special rights for intersection crossing. In this paper, we outline how group cycling commutes may be coordinated using communication capabilities of contemporary smartphones. We showcase how group cycling can reduce waiting times and, thus, improve ride comfort and safety in a simulation-based case study.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new visual explanation-based defense mechanism, namely, FedCAMAE, against model poisoning attacks on federated learning (FL), which integrates Layer Class Activation Mapping (LayerCAM) and autoencoder to offer a scientifically more powerful detection capability compared to existing Euclidean distance-based or machine learning-based approaches. Specially, FedCAMAE generates a fine-grained heat map assisted by Layer-CAM for each uploaded local model update, transforming each local model update into a lower-dimensional, visual representation. To accentuate the hidden features of the heat maps, autoencoder is seamlessly embedded into the proposed FedCAMAE, which can refine the the heat maps and enhance their distinguishability, thereby increasing the success rate of identifying anomalous heat maps and malicious local models. We test ResNet-50 and REGNETY-800MF deep learning models with SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets under Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) setting, respectively. The results demonstrate that Fed-CAMAE offers superior test accuracy of FL global model compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jjzgeeks/LayerCAM-AE},

abstract = {Most Wi-Fi backscatter systems have been proposed with mechanisms that decode the data from backscatter tags based on XOR operations. These XOR-based mechanisms require two receivers listening on the Wi-Fi and backscatter channels and consider the channel coding process as an obstacle to decode the backscatter packets. We focus on channel coding, which is a technique that all Wi-Fi systems use to detect and correct errors from the wireless channels. In our backscatter system, the tag reflects ambient Wi-Fi signals at the symbol level to transmit tag data. When the receiver demodulates and decodes these reflected signals, certain patterns of errors can be observed because of the symbol and subcarrier structures according to the OFDM scheme in Wi-Fi. We propose a method for detecting bit errors caused by backscatter tags and investigate the possibility of utilizing them in decoding.},

Today, CIoT applications generate large amounts of data in a multi-client accessible environment involving periodic addition of data. These systems require efficient searchable encryption to securely share data with authorized users, enable private keyword searches, and support frequent updates to outsourced data, thus maintaining data integrity and user privacy. Existing symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) schemes enable efficient searches for large datasets but are limited in providing multi-user data sharing. In contrast, attribute-based searchable encryption (ABSE) schemes offer fine-grained access control in collaborative scenarios but suffer from high search latency. In this paper, we present a hybrid searchable encryption scheme that enables secure keyword search with sublinear search efficiency and supports periodic dynamic addition of files in multi-client IoT environments. By providing privacy-preserving keyword searches with forward privacy and keyword-level access control, our approach effectively enhances security and performance for cloud-assisted IoT.},

To evaluate the robustness and reliability of our system and determine the optimal mounting position, we collected data from 5 volunteers with normal walking speeds and imitated various abnormal gait patterns and walking speeds.

abstract = {There has been a trend in passive IoT systems to move complexity from tag to reader for delivery of power, clock, and data [1, 2]. However, current designs either cannot deliver all these three simultaneously, or fail to do so in a co-optimized way, which leads to poor operating range and long charging time of passive IoT systems. To address this key bottleneck, we present 3in1, the first system co-design that optimizes Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) efficiency, accurate wireless clocking, and downlink communication simultaneously. We propose several novel designs: (i) an optimized multi-tone WPT waveform compliant with ISM band and FCC regulations; (ii) a robust and accurate wireless clocking mechanism integrated within the optimized waveform; (iii) a multi-tone Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) downlink modulation scheme that maintains wireless clocking accuracy and WPT efficiency; and (iv) an ultra-low power receiver capable of simultaneously extracting power, clock, and data from the optimized waveform. Preliminary results demonstrate that higher WPT efficiency, precise wireless clocking, and downlink communication can be achieved simultaneously within a co-optimized waveform. We believe this paves the way for the next generation of passive IoT system design.},

abstract = {Cross technology communication (CTC) facilitates direct communication between heterogeneous wireless technologies in the overlapped frequencies such as the 2.4 GHz ISM band. In this poster, we propose a novel method named WBMC for direct multicast communication from a Wi-Fi device to multiple BLE transceivers. This is achieved by making a Wi-Fi signal appear like BLE's Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) signal over multiple subcarrier groups of Wi-Fi. Uniqueness of WBMC compared to prior Wi-Fi-to-BLE CTC studies is that one Wi-Fi transmission can deliver distinct data to multiple BLE receivers simultaneously. The potential and feasibility of the newly suggested approach is demonstrated through implementation on GNURadio.},

abstract = {This study examines how an airborne device can intercept underwater acoustic signals exchanged between submerged nodes. It challenges the conventional belief that acoustic communications under the water are safe against eavesdropping since acoustics do not cross the water-air boundary. We show that an airborne mmWave radar can detect and decode underwater acoustic signals by picking up minute surface vibrations induced by these signals. The proof-of-concept was tested in controlled (pool) and uncontrolled (lake) environments, proving that an airborne adversary can identify modulation type, bitrate, and decode symbols from an uncooperative underwater transmitter using its radar sensing capabilities. We demonstrate that the secrecy of underwater links depends on modulation type, providing insights into countermeasures to enhance the security of underwater acoustic communications.},

abstract = {Over half a trillion recreational runners worldwide engage in running for psychological, health, and social benefits. Running metrics are essential for motivation, goal setting, performance improvement, health management, and injury prevention. Although wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches offer various metrics, they often perform poorly on treadmills and can be uncomfortable or restrictive. In this work, we propose a non-contact, real-time, smartphone-based approach to estimate running metrics, including cadence, ground contact time (GCT), and balance, using the sound produced during treadmill running. In collaboration with a licensed running coach, we recruited over 50 subjects with varying levels of running expertise. We collected treadmill running sounds and ground-truth running metrics in different environments. We designed and developed a multi-task learning (MTL) machine learning mobile system to capture the treadmill running sounds and estimate running metrics in situ. Our proposed method shows comparable accuracy in estimating running metrics to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wearable devices.},

Experiment results show that IoTCoder can synthesize programs adopting more IoT-specific algorithms and outperform state-of-the-art code LLMs in terms of both task accuracy (by more than 24.2\% on average) and memory usage (by less than 358.4 MB on average).},

Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between soil carbon content and both the soil permittivity obtained from Wi-Fi signals and the soil lightness captured in soil surface images. We develop mathematical models to quantify the relationships between soil carbon content and the two signal modalities, and use the models to estimate soil carbon. We apply machine learning to help handle relationships that mathematical models do not capture. Our experiments demonstrate that Scarf delivers highly accurate soil carbon estimations.},

BiScatter2 incorporates passive differential circuitry on backscatter tags for efficient, low-power decoding and extends its coverage range by combining the tag decoder and retro-reflective structure.

abstract = {Voice assistive technologies have given rise to extensive privacy and security concerns. In this paper we investigate whether robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) can be done in a privacy preserving manner on resource constrained devices. For inference, speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers that host state of the art (SOTA) foundation models (FM) demanding high memory usage and computation complexity. Considering the infeasibility to run these SOTA FM on-device, users are forced to offload their sensitive content to cloud for better inference compromising privacy. Sanitization can be done on speech content at the edge keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising the ASR accuracy. Our solution is based on the observation that although tiny on-device FM cannot perform robust ASR, they are powerful enough to mask the sensitive segments in speech. Given this observation, we introduce SpeechGuard - a privacy-preserving, hybrid edge-cloud ASR inference engine that is compute inexpensive. We present a novel times-tamp based entity filtering mechanism at the edge and a corresponding confidence score based recovery approach. Our results denote that SpeechGuard offers ASR accuracy and privacy guarantee comparable to existing SOTA FM, while achieving significant speedup and reduction in memory usage.},

abstract = {On-device sensors in mobile systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles and AR/VR, use odometry for real-time positioning, but they risk capturing sensitive data of non-consenting bystanders. Prior works have investigated various privacy-preserving techniques to protect those sensitive data. However, it is still unclear about the impact of such approaches on the accuracy of odometry. In this work, we investigate the impact of various privacy-preserving obfuscation techniques on the accuracy of monocular visual odometry. We focus on three widely used obfuscation methods: Gaussian Blur, Gaussian Noise, and Laplacian Noise, applied to protect bystander privacy. Our investigation reveals that some obfuscation techniques can increase the odometry errors by up to 56.9\%, while others surprisingly reduce the errors by up to 66.8\%, compared to raw data. Our key findings indicate that data obfuscation primarily affects the duration of tracking loss in ORB-SLAM3, which is the main source of the errors, and successful relocalization immediately following tracking loss plays a crucial role in reducing the overall errors.},

abstract = {Speech super-resolution techniques offer a promising solution to enhance audio quality in wearable devices, particularly when addressing the challenges of reduced sampling rates necessitated by battery life constraints and network instability. However, existing methods either prove computationally prohibitive for mobile platforms, or lack sufficient performance. We present TraMSR, a novel hybrid model combining transformer and Mamba architectures for acoustic speech super-resolution. TraMSR achieves superior performance while significantly reducing computational demands compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our model outperforms GAN-based approaches by up to 7.3\% in Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and 1.8\% in Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), with an order of magnitude smaller memory footprint and up to 465 times faster inference speed.},

abstract = {Batteryless sensor nodes powered solely by energy harvesting are a promising alternative to battery-powered sensor nodes. However, since the energy harvesting rate from these sources is often very low, unreliable, and time-varying, nodes cannot sustain a continuous operation, making them intermittently powered with unpredictable wakeup times. Moreover, energy harvesting rates differ significantly across deployment scenarios, influenced by environmental conditions, technology, and source availability. Current platforms are mainly designed to be best-effort with performance and reliability dictated by variations in incident input power. Therefore, application that demand critical end-to-end latency fails to achieve high Quality of Services (QOS) due to nodes not being able to compute and communicate in a timely and coordinated manner. Along with collecting, recording and distributing debug information, we propose a novel platform that enable robust coordination of on-times, timely computing and communication. Preliminary results on parts of our platform show nearly 99\% coordination between pairs of sensor nodes and over 10x performance benefits for time critical inference tasks.},

Additionally, the Swin Transformer is introduced to the JSCC codec to accelerate the semantic coding. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed LVSC performs better than the baseline methods in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM while inferring much faster at the same time.},

abstract = {A microwave radiometer (MWR) at NOAA-CESSRST in Manhattan, NYC has experienced interference from nearby sources operating in the 5G FR2 n257 band (26.50--29.50 GHz). In this poster, we produce interference using a mobile 28 GHz IBM Phased Array Antenna Module (PAAM). The mobile PAAM leverages a software-defined radio which offers flexibility in varying center frequency, modulation, gain, bandwidth, time schedule, and more. In this poster, we show preliminary experiments which successfully created controlled interference to a MWR's 28 GHz channel which lead to distortion in some of the MWR final products, such as water vapor profile. We transmitted a 10 MHz bandwidth OFDM signal with varying amplitude, observing the highly sensitive MWR voltage response to fractional dB increments of the transmitter gain. The mobile PAAM is characterized in an anechoic chamber and MWR measurements are taken at various azimuth angles to help estimate the MWR antenna pattern. Future work will develop a Spectrum Consumption Model to help enable coexistence of MWRs and Beyond-5G networks.},

abstract = {In the ongoing evolution of mobile networks, a key emerging focus is on "openness": disaggregation to enable multiple vendors. The obvious example of this is OpenRAN, a movement to open the traditionally-single-vendor RAN, to multiple vendors. However, despite the clear benefits that this approach has brought to the RAN, there has been little interest in applying this philosophy to other parts of the mobile network such as the mobile core. We argue that applying the philosophy of openness to the mobile core will result in significant ecosystem improvements to both mobile network operators and governments. In addition, we identify the key challenges for an "open core", formulate a set of criteria for evaluating openness of core designs, and assess current alternatives with respect those criteria.},

abstract = {Large language models are being deployed for various applications, and they are being scaled to larger parameter sizes. However, this makes it challenging to use these models for embedded applications due to the limited computing memory and processing capabilities available on embedded platforms. Consequently, it limits the usage of these models to invocation through function calls to a remotely hosted platform, which introduces latency and privacy challenges. A smaller parameter-sized language model running locally on embedded platforms could mitigate this challenge. However, such smaller models make trade-offs with dataset diversity and parameters, leading to inaccurate prompt responses and high hallucination rates. In response, we present our ongoing work: OTTER, a framework for pre-training custom language models and fine-tuning language models for embedded applications. We observe that smaller parameter-sized models outperform larger ones when curated with appropriate pre-training and fine-tuning datasets. Their smaller size allows these models to perform inference on constrained embedded platforms. Building on this framework, we train a custom model for breathing detection and observe high accuracy.},

GPSense Respiration operates by receiving and analyzing the GNSS signals reflected by the human body without additional pre-deployed signal transmitters. Also, GPSense Respiration system will not affect wireless communications because GNSS signals operate at different frequencies than communication signals.

abstract = {5G New Radio cellular networks are designed to provide high Quality of Service for application on wirelessly connected devices. However, changing conditions of the wireless last hop can degrade application performance, and the applications have no visibility into the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN). Most 5G network operators run closed networks, limiting the potential for co-design with the wider-area internet and user applications. This paper demonstrates NR-Scope, a passive, incrementally-deployable, and independently-deployable Standalone 5G network telemetry system that can passively measure fine-grained RAN capacity, latency, and retransmission information. Application servers can take advantage of the measurements to achieve better millisecond scale, application-level decisions on offered load and bit rate adaptation than end-to-end latency measurements or end-to-end packet losses currently permit. We demonstrate the performance of NR-Scope by decoding the downlink control information (DCI) for downlink and uplink traffic of a 5G Standalone base station in real-time.},

abstract = {Passive IoT localization technology offers significant advantages across various applications due to its self-sustaining, maintenance-free, and low-cost nature. However, existing systems cannot effectively address the multipath problem in real-world deployments, leading to unreliable localization results in the severe multipath scenario. We propose to fill the gap with UWB2, the first ultra-wideband backscatter passive IoT system that can achieve centimeter-level 99th percentile accuracy even under severe multipath environments. The demo will illustrate UWB2's performance in localization accuracy, latency, operating range, and power consumption in severe multipath scenarios.},

abstract = {In complex environments where visibility is severely compromised, such as smoke-filled areas or dense forests, traditional single-sensor systems often fail to provide accurate and reliable data for robots to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles effectively, posing significant operational challenges and safety risks. Ground-based sensing platforms are further limited by their restricted mobility, hindering access to remote or hazardous areas. Multimodal sensing, which combines various sensor technologies, offers a robust solution to these challenges. Drones, with their high maneuverability and ability to reach inaccessible locations, can capture detailed data from varied altitudes and perspectives. In this demonstration, we introduce SPECTRA, a drone-based multispectral sensing platform that combines thermal cameras, LiDAR, mmWave, and RGB cameras to reliably perform tasks in challenging environments. SPECTRA is a software-hardware co-design platform that can enable and fuse different sensors locally based on the dynamic environment and interpret user tasks using Large Language Models (LLM). We demonstrate SPECTRA's ability to explore and execute assigned tasks in complex environments.},

abstract = {Foundation models excel in tasks such as content generation, zero-shot classifications, and reasoning. However, they struggle with sensing, interacting, and actuating in the physical world due to their dependence on limited sensors and actuators in providing timely contextual information or physical interactions. This reliance restricts the system's adaptability and coverage. To address these issues and create an embodied AI with foundation models (FMs), we introduce Embodied Reconfigurable Drone Agent (EmbodiedRDA). EmbodiedRDA features a custom drone platform that can autonomously swap payloads to reconfigure itself with a diverse list of sensors and actuators. We designed FM agents to instruct the drone to equip itself with appropriate physical modules, analyze sensor data, make decisions, and control the drone's actions. This enables the system to perform a variety of tasks in dynamic physical environments, bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds.},

abstract = {Low Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) has shown its long-distance and low-power features for aboveground Internet-of-Things (IoT) communication, presenting a potential to extend to underground cross-soil communication over a wide area, which has not been investigated before. The variation of soil conditions brings significant signal polarization misalignment, degrading communication reliability. We propose Demeter, a low-cost, low-power programmable antenna design to keep reliable cross-soil communication automatically. First, we propose a hardware architecture to enable polarization adjustment on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) single-RF-chain LoRa radio. Moreover, we develop a low-power programmable circuit to adjust polarization. We further design an energy-efficient heuristic calibration algorithm to keep signal polarization alignment automatically. We demonstrate Demeter in indoor environments. The antenna is buried in a plastic container filled with gardening soil to simulate the node underground. Meanwhile, we use the COTS LoRa gateway as a receiver to show the RSSI and SNR variations.},

This system addresses the inherent limitations of traditional LiDAR sensors, such as narrow FOV, low resolution, and lack of flexible focusing capability. By scanning blind spots and dynamically focusing on areas of interest, αLiDAR significantly surpasses conventional LiDAR sensors. Our prototypes, tested under varied real-world conditions, have demonstrated marked improvements in typical LiDAR applications. Specifically, αLiDAR enhances 3D mapping accuracy, coverage, and density by factors of 8.5, 2, and 1.6, respectively. Furthermore, the adaptive rotational mechanism of αLiDAR extends the effective sensing distance by 1.8\texttimes{} and increases object detection by 1.9×.

Critically, a major bottleneck in wideband FD deployments is the need for adaptive SI cancellation (SIC) that would allow the FD wireless system to achieve strong cancellation across different settings with distinct electromagnetic environments. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an adaptive wideband FD radio in three different locations and demonstrate that it achieves strong SIC in every location across different bandwidths.},

abstract = {The Open RAN architecture, featuring disaggregated and virtualized RAN functions communicating over standardized interfaces, promises a diverse, multi-vendor ecosystem. However, these features also increase operational complexity, complicating the troubleshooting of RAN performance issues and failures. Addressing this challenge requires a reliable, explainable anomaly detection method, which Open RAN currently lacks. To address this problem, we have developed SpotLight, a tailored distributed deep learning method running across the edge and cloud. SpotLight continuously detects and localizes anomalies by analyzing a diverse, fine-grained stream of metrics from the RAN and platform. It employs a novel multi-stage generative model to identify potential anomalies at the edge using a lightweight algorithm, followed by anomaly confirmation and an explainability phase in the cloud, which pinpoints the minimal set of KPIs responsible for the anomaly. In this demo, using a carrier-grade indoor Open RAN testbed with configurable anomaly event generation and replay, we highlight (1) the difficulty of troubleshooting problems in Open RAN and (2) accurate, efficient, and explainable online anomaly detection with SpotLight and corresponding visualization in comparison with prior art.},

Our system accurately estimates robot motion, allowing for coherent imaging through a dense grid of synthetic antennas.

abstract = {Micronutrient imbalance is a global issue, and its detection is invasive and expensive. Despite being largely preventable, imbalances of one or more micronutrients is pervasive and has major downstream health effects [1]. Women, children, and underserved populations in particular bear the greatest burden of micronutrient imbalance [4--6]. However, the true scope of this issue is often unseen and unaddressed because of the barriers to accessible micronutrient status assessment [2]. Status assessment of micronutrients is often done via indirect, subjective dietary logs, in-person clinical examinations, or complex analyses on blood (e.g. liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry). While valuable, these assessments are expensive, flawed, and burdensome on the patient and the clinician.As a step towards mitigating this barrier, we explore the application of mobile spectrophotometry to determine concentrations of B vitamins in a solution. Spectrophotometry is the analysis of light (primarily visible light) as it is absorbed and transmitted by a constituent in a solution [10]. By analyzing how much light at a particular wavelength is absorbed by the sample, we can determine the relative concentration of a constituent or even its identity.},

This demo presents SliceGuard, a two-level scheduling system that leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to allow slice owners to run customized schedulers in a secure, platform-independent environment, while the network operator manages inter-slice resource allocation. We demonstrate dynamic slicing for cloud gaming over 5G and show how Wasm enables real-time scheduler updates and fault isolation.

abstract = {Detecting the target speaker and enhancing speech with high fidelity has been a long-standing problem, especially in challenging acoustic conditions. To address these problems with minimal user cooperation, we have developed multimodal audioradio speech detection (RadioVAD) and enhancement (RadioSES) systems using mmWave modality. This demo presents how these two systems can be run together in real time to extract target speech and filter any type of ambient noise. Our demo uses an mmWave radar and a microphone attached to a laptop to detect and localize target speakers in the field of view, detect the presence of voice to trigger the microphone, and enhance the noisy speech with a deep learning model running in real-time. Our experiments confirm that an audioradio system can detect and isolate high-fidelity target speech, even with interfering speech and noise; while being privacy preserving and environmentally robust.},

abstract = {In-car child presence detection (CPD) has become a crucial vehicular safety measure to prevent heat-related injuries or fatalities of unattended children. However, existing CPD solutions based on sensors and cameras have limitations in accuracy, coverage, and additional cost. To address these challenges, leveraging existing in-car WiFi facilities has emerged as a promising solution. Nevertheless, current WiFi-based CPD solutions are not robust against environmental impacts and often generate unnecessary detection alerts when an adult is present in the car. In this demonstration, we propose a novel, robust CPD architecture designed to enhance performance under various conditions while minimizing false alarms. Our design incorporates three main systems: presence detection, seat localization, and child vs. adult classification. To validate the system's performance, we developed a prototype using existing WiFi devices operating at 5 GHz and conducted a series of experiments.

Here, we demonstrate the broad applicability of on-device speech filtering using a detect-and-remove method for acoustic sensing tasks, significantly reducing privacy risks in revealing speech content.

Privacy concerns make storing raw audio and performing post-hoc analysis undesirable for many users. Additionally, current on-device audio processing systems for smartwatches are limited in their feature extraction capabilities, restricting their potential for understanding user behavior and health. We developed a real-time system for on-device audio processing on smartwatches, which takes an average of 1.78 minutes (SD = 0.07 min) to extract 22 spectral and rhythmic features from a 1-minute audio sample, using a small window size of 25 milliseconds. Using these extracted audio features on a public dataset, we developed and incorporated models into a watch to classify foreground and background speech in real-time. Our Random Forest-based model classifies speech with a balanced accuracy of 80.3\%.},

These transmitters utilize backscatter or tunnel diode-based mechanisms to enable low-power transmissions by delegating energy-intensive tasks to external infrastructure. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the need for specialized deployment setups, such as the precise placement of carrier-emitting devices. To overcome this, we are developing GateHaul-a low-cost gateway architecture that provides the required carrier signal, coordinates with other gateways, collects sensor data, and backhauls the information. Notably, GateHaul can backhaul sensor data without conventional networks utilizing emerging opportunistic backhaul networks. We demonstrate an early prototype of GateHaul that collects information from backscatter and conventional devices and backhauls the collected information using Apple's FindMy network.},

However, network performance and user experience can be critically impacted by malicious traffic, identified as anomaly traffic and intrusion methods. Addressing these challenges requires optimized resource sharing and robust network security measures. In this paper, we present an AI/ML-driven Network Intrusion Detection framework with dynamic resource allocation and user management within the O-RAN architecture. Our Anomaly Traffic Detector (ATD) enhances network security by mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through an xApp that classifies network traffic in real-time and dynamically adjusts network resources and user connections. Experimental evaluations show that our system effectively maintains low latency under attack conditions, nearly doubles the throughput for legitimate users, and reduces average CPU usage by up to 15\%. We use as reference platforms the OpenAirInterface, and FlexRIC for programming the slice and user connectivity decisions at the RAN level, and evaluate our scheme under real-world settings in a testbed environment.},

abstract = {The smart buildings of the future need to understand the movement and occupancy of the people in the environment. Using cameras to provide this context can be privacy-invasive. Alternatively, installing dedicated hardware to sense the environment can be cost-prohibitive and limit ubiquitous adoption. WiFi-based sensing has hence been championed to provide this building-scale sensing, as it allows for both privacy and is ubiquitously deployed in most buildings. However, industry-translatable research in this space has been challenging as no building-scale systems can provide WiFi sensing data. Consequently, many real-world challenges of deploying these sensing systems remain a mystery. To overcome this veil of mystery, we develop and open-source WiSenseHub, a building-scale WiFi-sensing system. We build our system on commercially available WiFi radios, deploy our backend services to collect data on infinitely scalable AWS cloud or a local server desktop, and build a front-end phone-based interface to collect diverse WiFi sensing data. We deployed multiple WiFi radios in our building and collected data for user devices for over 38 hours.},

abstract = {The performance of IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks is determined by the multi-parameter resource control of transmit and receive settings. With today's WiFi transceivers, controllable parameters include data rate, power, frame transmission aggregation, and global receiver settings like sensitivity. Despite its importance, research on IEEE 802.11 MAC-layer resource control over the past two decades has primarily relied on simulations.Evaluating WiFi resource control schemes in real systems typically requires software changes to the low-level MAC layer components or vendor-specific device drivers. Consequently, current WiFi systems research lacks a well-abstracted, fine-grained, and remotely controllable interface for applying and analyzing new optimizations targeting capacity, latency, bandwidth, or their combined effects. As a result, only a few practical control algorithms have been implemented, validated, and evaluated in real WiFi systems.We introduce a new set of system tools that enable efficient, fine-grained, and distributed resource control with off-the-shelf Linux-based WiFi transceivers. Our tools significantly simplify developing, validating, and evaluating new control algorithms, allowing researchers to use their preferred high-level programming languages. Our contributions include the ORCA toolchain, which comprises three components: (I) A high-performance and well-abstracted Linux kernel user space API called 'ORCA', designed for monitoring and controlling WiFi resource control parameters across different WiFi chipsets from various vendors, (II) an interface for active remote control and passive telemetry of dynamic resource control using ORCA, and (III) a Python package named 'RateMan', which enables software-defined management of WiFi resource control over multiple access points, on a per station basis.},

abstract = {The mobile network operation in the unlicensed spectrum offers opportunities for non-public connectivity services without the financial burden of spectrum licensing. Previous studies regarding unlicensed spectrum operation have mainly relied on analysis or simulation without addressing practical constraints. In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated the listen-before-talk protocol as a co-existence medium access mechanism on top of the 5G-NR physical layer. We propose different TDD configurations to enable different sensing frequencies. We enabled OpenAirInterface operation in the n46/n47 bands, a European band dedicated to connected intelligent transportation services. We evaluate the performance of unlicensed 5G-NR under bursty cross-traffic from a different device. The results show that the frequency of cross-traffic bursts affects BLER (Block Error Rate) and throughput more than their duration. The design of the TDD frame to offer more frequent sensing opportunities allows for reduced BLER but negatively impacts achievable throughput in the current setup.},

abstract = {LoRa is about to become the standard for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), being well suited for many Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network applications. The success of the technology sparked interest to adopt LoRa for other, more challenging use-cases in industrial automation or control of cyber-physical systems. Regular LoRa gateways are, however, limited in their number of parallel demodulation paths and restricted to a single network. To overcome this limitation, we implement a software-defined, multichannel LoRa receiver that is able to receive all common spreading factors and uplink channel combinations of the LoRaWAN EU868 frequency plan. In addition, our receiver does not rely on hard-coded sync words, enabling a mechanism similar to monitor mode in WLAN networks. Experimental evaluation using Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) confirms superior performance compared to commercial LoRa gateways.},

In this context, we design and implement AraSync as an end-to-end time synchronization system in the ARA wireless living lab to enable advanced wireless experiments and applications involving stringent time constraints. We make use of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at different levels to achieve synchronization accuracy in the order of nanoseconds. Along with fiber networks, AraSync enables time synchronization across the AraHaul wireless x-haul network consisting of long-range, high-capacity mmWave and microwave links. In this paper, we present the detailed design and implementation of AraSync, including its hardware and software components and the PTP network topology. Further, we experimentally characterize the performance of AraSync from spatial and temporal dimensions. Our measurement and analysis of the clock offset and mean path delay show the impact of the wireless channel and weather conditions on the PTP synchronization accuracy.},

abstract = {Robust classification of the operational environment of wireless devices is becoming increasingly important for wireless network optimization, particularly in a shared spectrum environment. Distinguishing between indoor and outdoor devices can enhance reliability and improve coexistence with existing, outdoor, incumbents. For instance, the unlicensed but shared 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) enables sharing by imposing lower transmit power for indoor unlicensed devices and a spectrum coordination requirement for outdoor devices. Further, indoor devices are prohibited from using battery power, external antennas, and weatherization to prevent outdoor operations. As these rules may be circumvented, we propose a robust indoor/outdoor classification method by leveraging the fact that the radio-frequency environment faced by a device are quite different indoors and outdoors. We first collect signal strength data from all cellular and Wi-Fi bands that can be received by a smartphone in various environments (indoor interior, indoor near windows, and outdoors), along with GPS accuracy, and then evaluate three machine learning (ML) methods: deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, and random forest to perform classification into these three categories. Our results indicate that the DNN model performs the best, particularly in minimizing the most important classification error, that of classifying outdoor devices as indoor interior devices.},

abstract = {While the availability of large datasets has been instrumental to advance fields like computer vision and natural language processing, this has not been the case in mobile networking. Indeed, mobile traffic data is often unavailable due to privacy or regulatory concerns. This problem becomes especially relevant in Open Radio Access Network (RAN), where artificial intelligence can potentially drive optimization and control of the RAN, but still lags behind due to the lack of training datasets. While substantial work has focused on developing testbeds that can accurately reflect production environments, the same level of effort has not been put into twinning the traffic that traverse such networks.To fill this gap, in this paper, we design a methodology to twin real-world cellular traffic traces in experimental Open RAN testbeds. We demonstrate our approach on the Colosseum Open RAN digital twin, and publicly release a large dataset (more than 500 hours and 450 GB) with PHY-, MAC-, and App-layer Key Performance Measurements (KPMs), and protocol stack logs. Our analysis shows that our dataset can be used to develop and evaluate a number of Open RAN use cases, including those with strict latency requirements.},

The testbed features three custom-designed Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC-based Software Defined Radios (SDRs) empowered with the Pi-Radio fully digital transceivers. Two of these SDRs support eight transmit and receive streams each (8 \texttimes{} 8 MIMO), while the third SDR supports up to four channels. m3MIMO supports three different communication modes: (i) point-to-point (P2P) transmissions; (ii) single-user multi-input multi-output (SU-MIMO), where multiple streams are transmitted to a single end-device; and (iii) MU-MIMO, where two devices are simultaneously served by a single transmitter. To showcase the m3MIMO's versatility, we present two research use cases: tracking-based beamforming and mmWave-based sensing. We will open-source the m3MIMO code along with the relevant use-case datasets, facilitating further analysis1.},

Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically adjust video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity, aiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR algorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR streaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that provide a robust characterization of the network state, enabling more informed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance indicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the implemented network performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's adaptation capabilities.},

abstract = {mmWave antenna array calibration is a necessary yet tedious and costly process in manufacturing to capture the non-idealities in phased arrays, in order to obtain codebooks for accurate and stable beam steering. Unfortunately, predefined codebooks provided by manufacturers to steer beams in a given set of directions do not support the arbitrary beam shapes required for various mmWave communication, sensing, and security applications. To create arbitrary beam patterns, one needs to first find the unknown calibration vector for the particular phased array in use. In this paper, we introduce EiCal, a novel zero-shot technique that leverages the beamforming codebook advertised by the manufacturer to extract the calibration vector at zero cost (i.e., with no additional measurements). The key idea is that the unknown desired calibration vector can be obtained via an appropriately designed eigen-decomposition of the given codebook. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of EiCal on a 60 GHz mmWave array for two scenarios: angle estimation using compressive pseudorandom beams, and simultaneous steering of beams and nulls. Our results also point to potential simplifications in the calibration process at the manufacturer.},

However, these applications demand accurate and reliable positioning performance, which has led to the proposal of newer positioning techniques. To further advance the research on these techniques, in this paper, we develop a 3GPP-compliant 5G positioning testbed, incorporating gNodeBs (gNBs) and User Equipment (UE). The testbed uses New Radio (NR) Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) transmitted by the gNB to generate Time of Arrival (TOA) estimates at the UE. We mathematically model the inter-gNB and UE-gNB time offsets affecting the TOA estimates and examine their impact on positioning performance. Additionally, we propose a calibration method for estimating these time offsets. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental impact on the TOA estimates. Our findings are based on our mathematical model and supported by experimental results.},

abstract = {RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) are programmable platforms that enable data-driven closed-loop control in the O-RAN architecture. They collect telemetry and data from the RAN, process it in custom applications, and enforce control or new configurations on the RAN. Such custom applications in the Near-Real-Time (RT) RIC are called xApps, and enable a variety of use cases related to radio resource management. Despite numerous open-source and commercial projects focused on the Near-RT RIC, developing and testing xApps that are interoperable across multiple RAN implementations is a time-consuming and technically challenging process. This is primarily caused by the complexity of the protocol of the E2 interface, which enables communication between the RIC and the RAN while providing a high degree of flexibility, with multiple Service Models (SMs) providing plug-and-play functionalities such as data reporting and RAN control. In this paper, we propose xDevSM, an open-source flexible framework for O-RAN service models, aimed at simplifying xApp development for the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) Near-RT RIC. xDevSM reduces the complexity of the xApp development process, allowing developers to focus on the control logic of their xApps and moving the logic of the E2 service models behind simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by deploying and testing xApps across various RAN software platforms, including OpenAirInterface and srsRAN. This framework significantly facilitates the development and validation of solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks, including the testing of data-driven solutions across multiple RAN implementations.},

By incorporating causal masking and agent-wise interaction modeling, MAMGDT maintains temporal accuracy and captures the dynamics of agent interactions effectively. With the potential to optimize decision processes, MAMGDT is well-suited for various multi-agent tasks.

This process not only aids in diabetes management but also highlights the importance of taking additional precautions after a diabetes diagnosis. Currently, glucose test strips are widely used to measure the glucose concentration of liquids. It's safe, effective, easy to use, and a cheap alternative to other complex technology with the same use. However, it has sevral setbacks, such as its inability to accurately measure the glucose concentration of cold liquids (0°C - 10°C). This lack of variability can lead to more inconvenience for individuals than benefits.

EventTracker incorporates a collaborative object detection and tracking algorithm optimized for both event and depth data, overcoming detection and registration challenges.

abstract = {Quantification of information leakage is crucial, especially for privacy-preserving systems such as location-based services (LBS) with integrated privacy mechanisms. Existing quantification mainly utilized two approaches: i) the white-box approach, precise but impractical for complex systems, and ii) the black-box approach, practical but struggles with scalability for large output spaces. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been integrated into the black-box approach to effectively approximate information leakage for independent observations with better scalability. However, this method does not provide precise estimates for dependent observations. Intuitively, once a correlated secret is discovered, it becomes easier for an attacker to predict related secrets, leading to an underestimation of information leakage. This paper introduces an ML-based black-box approach to improve the accuracy of information leakage estimation for systems with correlated data, particularly in trace-based scenarios. Our solution uses an ML model for rough estimation and leverages data correlations to refine inferences for more accurate quantification. Evaluation results from three real-world datasets and one collected dataset confirm our solution's effectiveness in accurately and cost-effectively quantifying system leakage for correlated observations.},

abstract = {In many real-world applications, 16-beam LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3DOD) is indispensable in scene understanding. However, the absence of well-labeled large-scale 16-beam LiDAR datasets impedes the development of these 3DOD methods. To avoid annotation costs in developing datasets, we proposed an energy-based active learning method for cross-beam domain adaptation, which effectively transfers the knowledge from the existing well-labeled 64-beam counterpart. Specifically, the cross-beam domain gap between the source (64-beam) and the target (16-beam) domain is reduced by aligning the deep features based on an energy-based feature-matching loss term during training. Moreover, the proposed energy-based active learning method enables the sampling strategy to shed light on selecting the most valuable 16-beam target samples to be manually labeled, which are then added to the training set. Experimental results show that our method can effectively transfer the knowledge from the 64-beam domain to the 16-beam one, and successfully learns a high-performance 16-beam 3DOD model with only a small portion of unlabeled data to annotate.},

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) further empowers pursuit strategies with the potential to emerge complex behaviors. However, existing solutions lack the ability to handle the perception uncertainty caused by relative position measurement noises, which blurs the understanding of the target's state and complicates the pursuit strategy learning process. This study proposes PUARL, which enhances the learning under the perception uncertainty process by guiding exploration with probabilistic estimation and adapting the policy based on awareness of perception uncertainty. We validate its performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. PUARL achieves a success rate increase of 12.3\%+ and a reduction in total steps by 58.3\%+, outperforming both state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based solutions.},

To face the challenge, over-the-air computation (OAC) has been proposed for multi-sensor data aggregation, which enables the server to receive a desired function of massive sensing data during communication. However, the strict synchronization and accurate channel estimation constraints in OAC are hard to be satisfied in practice, leading to time and channel-gain misalignment. The paper formulates the misalignment problem as a non-blind image deblurring problem. At the receiver side, we first use the Wiener filter to deblur, followed by a U-Net network designed for further denoising. Our method is capable to exploit the inherent correlations in the signal data via learning, thus outperforms traditional methods in term of accuracy.

Traditional methods for anomaly detection, such as real-time monitoring of speed and direction, are inadequate in the face of data heterogeneity and the sheer volume of information. And the proposed anomaly detection system is designed to overcome these limitations: We introduce a multi-tiered strategy, dividing the anomaly detection task into critical points (including origin and destination) analysis and path analyses to effectively identify and categorize abnormal patterns. By concentrating different features or patterns in each tier, the detection capability of this system is effectively enhanced. Combining our evaluation metrics, the system can provide risk assessment for abnormal critical points and trajectories, thus ensuring the safety of both drivers and passengers.},

abstract = {Color constancy provides stable color features for high-level computer vision tasks such as target recognition and autonomous driving. Existing deep learning-based color constancy algorithms using convolutional neural networks remove the illumination and obtain images under standard illumination. However, these methods suffer from insufficient training data and poor robustness in complex scenes. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm: self-supervised color constancy with a collaborative generative network (CCCG). CCCG transforms the illumination estimation problem into a generation problem, reducing the solution space and enhancing algorithm robustness in complex scenes. Additionally, CCCG employs a self-supervised network structure, reducing dependence on light source label data. CCCG comprises two network structures: the Filter Network (FN) and the Illumination Network (IN). FN extracts features from the image and generates an image under standard illumination. IN incorporates the extracted physical light source information into the output results of FN and verifies the generated image. Experimental results on the Gehler-Shi and NUS-8 datasets show that CCCG outperforms current color constancy methods across various evaluation metrics and can be applied to other computer vision tasks requiring color constancy preprocessing.},

abstract = {Environment sensing is a fundamental task in mobile augmented reality (AR). However, on-device sensing and computing resources often limit mobile AR sensing capability, making high-quality environment sensing challenging to achieve. In recent years, in-context sensing, a new sensing system design paradigm, has emerged with the promise of achieving accurate, efficient, and robust sensing results. In this work, we first formally define the in-context sensing design paradigm. We summarize its primary challenges as the uncertainty of environmental information availability. To quantify the impact of sensing context data, we present two in-depth case studies that show how it can impact different aspects of mobile AR sensing systems.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) presents a rapidly evolving virtual world with varying types of visual content. Authenticating users periodically across different types of VR content to safeguard private data is a cornerstone in many sensitive VR applications. Previous studies have performed authentication by verifying users' actions or involuntary responses to certain visual stimuli. However, these methods tie users to either a predefined task or a single type of VR content, failing to support periodic authentication in dynamic VR interactions. In this paper, we propose a cross-content authentication framework that verifies users across different VR content by jointly analyzing eye movements and VR content. Specifically, we decouple displayed VR content from eye movements and generate a content-agnostic embedding determined by cognitive and physiological attributes unique to each user. Experiments with video viewing and text reading in VR show that our system achieves an F-score of 0.92 in cross-content user authentication.},

abstract = {In world-locked mixed reality (MR), virtual content is locked in place with respect to the real world. Pose estimation is a key component to create world-locked MR experiences by estimating the device's position and orientation in order to render the virtual content accordingly. Current methods of evaluating world-locked MR include user studies, which are time consuming, and absolute trajectory error (ATE), which does not directly represent what is shown on the user's display. In this work, we propose ReplayAR, a tool that can replay user movement traces and output the corresponding visualizations (renderings) of the MR display. ReplayAR can be used to compare renderings from different MR pose estimation methods side by side, using our proposed Visual Difference metric. We implemented ReplayAR on a Hololens 2 MR headset and used it to evaluate open and closed-source pose estimation methods on standard datasets and our own collected traces. The results suggest that Visual Difference better reflects what is shown on the MR display compared to ATE. We hope that ReplayAR can encourage reproducible evaluation of world-locked MR, and towards this, we release the open-source code.},

abstract = {Mixed-reality headsets offer new ways to perceive our environment. They employ visible spectrum cameras to capture and display the environment on screens in front of the user's eyes. However, these cameras lead to limitations. Firstly, they capture only a partial view of the environment. They are positioned to capture whatever is in front of the user, thus creating blind spots during complete immersion and failing to detect events outside the restricted field of view. Secondly, they capture only visible light fields, ignoring other fields like acoustics and radio that are also present in the environment. Finally, these power-hungry cameras rapidly deplete the mixed-reality headset's battery. We introduce PixelGen to rethink embedded cameras for mixed-reality headsets. PixelGen proposes to decouple cameras from the mixed-reality headset and balance resolution and fidelity to minimize the power consumption. It employs low-resolution, monochrome image sensors and environmental sensors to capture the surroundings around the headset. This approach reduces the system's communication bandwidth and power consumption. A transformer-based language and image model process this information to overcome resolution trade-offs, thus generating a higher-resolution representation of the environment. We present initial experiments that show PixelGen's viability.},

The network employs mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv), known for its enhanced feature extraction capabilities and resilience to noise. By leveraging a scale attention mechanism, we effectively integrate the outputs of each layer without the need for neural architecture search. Trained on multi-channel data under low SNR, the network formulates angle estimation as a multi-label classification task. Experimental results confirm that, the proposed network demonstrates superior accuracy in extreme noise conditions and with limited snapshots, outperforming existing methodologies in multi-source scenarios.},

abstract = {Joint task scheduling and resource allocation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in emergency rescue activities has become an essential and challenging problem. However, the existing works have only considered such a problem for standalone UAV networks without considering the cooperation between UAVs and ground base stations (BSs), nor have they considered the uncertainty in terms of the availability of BSs due to damage/reconstruction in disaster events. In this paper, we consider a novel post-disaster UAV-assisted ISAC system where the UAVs are used to supplement the networking capacity of out-of-service ground BSs while using their radio signals for sensing. We apply transfer learning with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn task scheduling and resource allocation strategies that can rapidly adapt to uncertainty in the environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in both communication and sensing performance and convergence speed. Moreover, the transfer learning-based DRL shows faster convergence and better robustness when the availability of BSs suddenly changes.},

With utility of multi-view sensing and multi-node joint transmission, cell-free is a promising technique to realize this prospect. This paper aims to tackle the problem of access point (AP) deployment in cell-free systems to balance the sensing accuracy and user rate. By merging the D-optimality with Euclidean criterion, a novel integrated metric is proposed to be the objective function for both max-sum and maxmin problems, which respectively guarantee the overall and lowest performance in multi-user communication and target tracking scenario. To solve the corresponding high dimensional non-convex multi-objective problem, the Soft actor-critic (SAC) is utilized to avoid risk of local optimal result. Numerical results demonstrate that proposed SAC-based APs deployment method achieves 20\% of overall performance and 120\% of lowest performance.},

In this paper, we study cooperative ISAC in cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where multiple MIMO access points (APs) collaboratively provide communication services and perform multistatic sensing. We formulate an optimization problem for the ISAC beamforming design, which maximizes the achievable sum-rate while guaranteeing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement and total power constraint. Learning-based techniques are regarded as a promising approach for addressing such a nonconvex optimization problem. By taking the topology of cell-free MIMO systems into consideration, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), namely SACGNN, for ISAC beamforming design. The proposed SACGNN framework models the cell-free MIMO system for cooperative ISAC as a heterogeneous graph and employs a transformer-based heterogeneous message passing scheme to capture the important information of sensing and communication channels and propagate the information through the graph network.

abstract = {Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems offer a promising solution to mitigate spectrum competition and hardware complexity in 5G/6G communication. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology has been commonly employed in current DFRC signals. However, many DFRC signal sequences exhibit poor range sidelobes, making them unsuitable for weak target detection. In this paper, we design encrypted sparse transmitting waveforms to encrypt signals. In the time domain, the DFRC signal's Peak Side Level (DPSL) is minimized to enhance radar detectability, while simultaneously constraining the communication Bit Error Ratio (BER) and the constant envelope value of the signal to maintain communication quality. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we develop a Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) framework, which alternately updates each communication phase location. This framework aims to lower the dual-function cross- and auto-correlation peak sidelobe levels, referred to as the Block Successive Upper bound Minimization for DFRC DPSL (BSUM-DPSL) algorithm. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness is theoretically validated, and simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of designed MIMO-OFDM waveform in comparison with other waveforms.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel design algorithm for dual-function radar communication (DFRC) Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. The algorithm achieves a tradeoff between detection performance and communication bit error rate (BER) performance. Firstly, the algorithm modulates communication information on the phase of the subcarrier coefficient of OFDM waveform using M-phase-shift keying (MPSK) schemes such as Binary-PSK (BPSK). Subsequently, the waveform minimises the weighted integrated sidelobe level (WISL) of the transmit waveform and the receive mismatch filter while ensuring the BER. Additionally, constraints are placed on constant amplitude, mainlobe energy and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. To address the non-convex optimization issues arising from algorithm design, a Weight Alternating Direction Method of Penalty (W-ADPM) network-based approach simultaneously optimises the transmit waveform and receives mismatched filters. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better convergence performance for the proposed waveform compared to the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Besides, compared to traditional matched filters, the jointly transmitted and received mismatched filters proposed in this paper provide better WISL cross-correlation performance while ensuring the BER.},

Integrating WPT with WSNs creates wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), where optimizing charging efficiency and scheduling is critical. This paper introduces an ISAC-facilitated optimal on-demand mobile charging scheme for IoT-based WRSNs (IOMSN) with three key components. First, it presents an ISAC-assisted prioritized charging queue, incorporating four attributes with probability distributions: residual energy, traffic load, MCV travel time, and direction angle. Second, it provides ISAC-driven estimations of MCV distance, speed, and location to enhance prioritization, thereby optimizing the charging route and potentially reducing travel costs. Third, a time-allocated partial charging model improves charging efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol outperforms cutting-edge protocols in energy usage efficiency, travel distance, charging delay, and service time.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known for their high flexibility and maneuverability, are regarded as the aerial platforms of future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. The communication and sensing functions of ISAC share the same spectrum and signal waveform, which often results in communication information being embedded within the sensing waveforms, thereby increasing the risk of information leakage. To enhance the security of UAV-assisted ISAC, we propose a beamforming strategy based on the mutual cooperation between communication and sensing. Specifically, by utilizing the sensing function to process echo signals, we estimate the positions of potential eavesdroppers and obstacles, which supports subsequent obstacle avoidance trajectory planning and physical layer security design. To ensure the transmission secrecy, we introduce artificial noise into the system. By designing the UAV transmit beamforming and the covariance matrix of the artificial noise, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received by the eavesdropper. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an optimization algorithm that combines Dinkelbach's transform and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results demonstrate that the SNR of eavesdropper remains at a low level throughout the flight of UAV, validating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The challenge of achieving ISAC in uplink massive access scenarios within the SAGIN has become a major research topic. This paper introduces the Resilient Massive Access (RMA) protocol, which deeply integrates S-ALOHA and NOMA, effectively enhancing the system's access success probability. Additionally, a cascaded uplink detection algorithm based on LS and MUSIC (MUSIC-NOMA-TSA) is proposed, enabling signal decoding and target sensing even in the presence of collisions at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only achieves more accurate signal decoding and target sensing but also significantly improves the access success probability.},

abstract = {Large-aperture coprime arrays (CAs) are expected to achieve higher sensing resolution than conventional dense arrays (DAs), yet with lower hardware and energy cost. However, existing CA far-field localization methods cannot be directly applied to near-field scenarios due to channel model mismatch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an efficient near-field localization method for CAs. Specifically, we first construct an effective covariance matrix, which allows to decouple the target angle-and-range estimation. Then, a customized two-phase multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for CAs is proposed, which first detects all possible targets' angles by using an angular-domain MUSIC algorithm, followed by the second phase to resolve the true targets' angles and ranges by devising a range-domain MUSIC algorithm. Finally, we show that the proposed method is able to locate more targets than the subarray-based method as well as achieve lower root mean square error (RMSE) than DAs.},

abstract = {The development of wireless communication technology is reshaping the landscape of intelligent transportation systems, particularly in the realm of internet of vehicles (IoV). Among these, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has garnered widespread attention by leveraging shared hardware resources or even spectrum between sensing and communication to achieve integrated benefits. For IoV, parameters such as target position and speed estimated by ISAC can be used as prior information for resource allocation and beamforming to improve communication performance. In this paper, we focus on ISAC-enabled IoV, where radar sensing signals and communication signals are transmitted within different slots of a subframe to avoid interference. We propose a resource allocation scheme to maximize system throughput while meeting the differentiated needs of all users, where spatial division multiple access is dynamically employed based on network load. Simulation outcomes verify the efficiency of the suggested algorithm.},

They require frequent recharge, especially when capturing and streaming information wirelessly. In particular, these devices stream information over the radio spectrum using transceivers that are power-hungry, and wireless communication dominates the energy budget of these devices. We present our ongoing work to design a system called Li-FiAR, which proposes integrating Li-Fi with augmented reality devices. Specifically, we implement a transmitter and receiver and integrate them with an augmented reality device. We argue that Li-Fi receivers may consume less power than their radio counterparts while benefiting from the spatial nature of light propagation.

abstract = {Large language models have attracted a significant recent interest, with an overwhelming efforts and emphasis on scaling their parameter size to support general-purpose and emergent capabilities. However, memory and processing requirements for model inference also scales proportionally with the model's parameter size. This makes it challenging for state-of-the-art, larger models to perform inference locally on edge and mobile devices, even though such models could benefit numerous tasks on these systems. Consequently, these devices are often restricted to accessing larger models through network calls. This approach introduces challenges related to increased inference latency due to network delays and provider capacity. It also raises concerns about sharing private information with third-party vendors. To address these issues, we are developing a system called OTTER. This system tackles the particular problem by enabling the training of smaller yet highly capable foundational language models. As a result of the reduced parameter size, these models can run locally even on constrained edge devices, such as mobile phones and wearables, and are able to provide low-latency responses compared with their larger remotely hosted counterparts. We present our ongoing work describing the framework as applied to training a smaller foundational model for embedded sensing application for tracking a person's breathing with high accuracy comparable to models orders of magnitude larger in size. Our results demonstrate that carefully pre-trained and fine-tuned smaller sized models outperform much larger counterparts for some tasks, while inferring locally on the constrained edge and mobile devices.},

abstract = {The proliferation of video analytics in applications like autonomous driving, traffic surveillance, and teleoperated vehicles requires on-premise (on edge) execution of deep learning models to meet latency requirements and curb bandwidth usage by limiting frequent offloading of inference tasks. However, constrained by the compute and power availability on the edge, a cheaper model is typically deployed. These shallower models have two major associated problems: 1) using the same model for all cameras/vehicles gives inconsistent accuracy, and 2) trained models are prone to data drift.In this work, we propose to address these problems using two strategies. The first strategy is to intelligently assign individual models to each camera/vehicle by clustering the ones with similar visual scenes to reduce the number of allocated models. Second, to circumvent the data drift, we re-train the model assigned to the cluster, which undergoes accuracy deviation.},

abstract = {Edge computing has emerged as an alternative to reduce transmission and processing delay and preserve privacy of the video streams. However, the ever-increasing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used in video-based applications (e.g. object detection) exerts pressure on memory-constrained edge devices. Model merging is proposed to reduce the DNNs' memory footprint by keeping only one copy of merged layers' weights in memory. In existing model merging techniques, (i) only architecturally identical layers can be shared; (ii) requires computationally expensive retraining in the cloud; (iii) assumes the availability of ground truth for retraining. The re-evaluation of a merged model's performance, however, requires a validation dataset with ground truth, typically runs at the cloud. Common metrics to guide the selection of shared layers include the size or computational cost of shared layers or representation size. We propose a new model merging scheme by sharing representations (i.e., outputs of layers) at the edge, guided by representation similarity S. We show that S is extremely highly correlated with merged model's accuracy with Pearson Correlation Coefficient |r| > 0.94 than other metrics, demonstrating that representation similarity can serve as a strong validation accuracy indicator without ground truth. We present our preliminary results of the newly proposed model merging scheme with identified challenges, demonstrating a promising research future direction.},

It allows data owners to set access policies based on attributes, ensuring only users who meet the criteria can decrypt and access the data. However, existing CP-ABE systems are inherently designed for static attributes and lack efficient support for dynamic user attributes, often necessitating frequent key updates and complex revocation processes. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced CP-ABE cryptosystem that allows for the dynamic generation of additional key components, which can be efficiently integrated with the user's existing key. The user private key is assigned attribute-level expiration tags, facilitating instant revocation. Additionally, our scheme facilitates the secure offloading of partial decryption of ciphertext to the cloud server using a transformed private key, thus reducing the computational overhead on resource-constrained user devices. Our proposed cryptosystem provides a secure and scalable approach for managing dynamic attributes in cloud environments with rapidly evolving access requirements.},

Older adults who are losing the ability to care for themselves or ambulate are at a high risk of adverse health outcomes and decreased quality of life. It is essential to monitor daily activities and mobility routinely and capture early decline before a clinical symptom arises. Existing solutions use self-reports, or technology-based solutions that depend on cameras or wearables to track daily activities; however, these solutions have different issues (e.g., bias, privacy, burden to carry/recharge them) and do not fit well for seniors. In this study, we discuss a non-invasive, and low-cost wireless sensing-based solution to track the daily activities of low-income older adults. The proposed sensing solution relies on a deep learning-based fine-grained analysis of ambient WiFi signals and it is non-invasive compared to video or wearable-based existing solutions. We deployed this system in real senior housing settings for a week and evaluated its performance.

Nonadherence has yet to be solved by digital health technologies. Forgetfulness is one of the main contributors to unintentional nonadherence, which hundreds of medication management apps and devices seek to address by generating time-based reminders. However, most medications are prescribed to be taken within a time frame, such as "in the morning" or "before breakfast," rather than at a specific hour. Similarly, many components of daily living occur within time frames rather than exact times. Timed reminders do not always correlate with prescription instructions nor daily life; this mismatch may lead to a patient's lack of success in reducing forgetfulness. In domains other than medication prescribed "as-needed," instead of timed reminders, have been successfully deployed. Borrowing this notion may lead to medication reminders that are accepted and responded to, reducing forgetfulness and leading to healthier aging in the home.},

abstract = {Utilizing fine grained analysis of wireless signals for human activity recognition has gained a lot of traction recently. The unique changes to the ambient wireless signals caused by different activities made it possible to recognize these fingerprints through deep learning classification methods. Most of the existing work consider a set of physical activities or gestures and try to recognize each one of them as a separate class. However, this makes the classification task harder especially when the number of activities to recognize becomes larger and when these activities include movements from the same body parts. To address that, in this study, we consider the decomposition of each physical activity into the limbs and body parts involved in that activity and study a one-by-one recognition solution. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based hierarchical method that not only recognizes the involved body limbs and facilitates the recognition of complex activities, but also mitigates the temporal effects in the collected signal data and thus provides a generalized solution. Our experimental evaluation shows that we can recognize unknown physical activities through the proposed hierarchical limb recognition based model with a small Hamming loss and by just using WiFi signal data from a single transmitter and receiver link.},

abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) apps have gained popularity over the past decade for patient health monitoring, yet their potential for timely intervention is underutilized due to limited integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems. Current EHR systems lack real-time monitoring capabilities for symptoms, medication adherence, physical and social functions, and community integration. Existing systems typically rely on static, in-clinic measures rather than dynamic, real-time patient data. This highlights the need for automated, scalable, and human-centered platforms to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) within EHR. Incorporating PGHD in a user-friendly format can enhance patient symptom surveillance, ultimately improving care management and post-surgical outcomes. To address this barrier, we have developed an mHealth platform, ROAMMEHR, to capture real-time sensor data and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a smartwatch. The ROAMM-EHR platform can capture data from a consumer smartwatch, send captured data to a secure server, and display information within the Epic EHR system using a user-friendly interface, thus enabling healthcare providers to monitor post-surgical symptoms effectively.},

abstract = {Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a significant global health challenge for the elderly with high mortality rates and complications. While imaging technologies like NIRS and hyperspectral imaging have improved wound assessment in clinical settings, their cost, and large size limit their use in the home and primary care. On the other hand, existing mobile solutions only capture secondary bio-markers like color and wound size. This paper introduces SigmoidOxy (or σ(Oxy)), a novel smartphone-based perfusion tool for DFU management. SigmoidOxy extracts oxygenation information from standard RGB images captured by smartphone cameras by applying hyperspectral reconstruction models to infer oxygenation. We evaluate SigmoidOxy's performance using the SPECTRALPACA dataset [2] finding an Average Persons R of 0.72 and Average Mean Absolute Error of 0.239 when comparing sigmoid oxygenation signals and analyze its sensitivity to ischemia in the DFUC2021 dataset [17].},

The combination of network slicing and Open Radio Access Network (RAN) enables TOs to provide more customized network services and higher commercial benefits. However, in the current Open RAN community, an open-source end-to-end slicing solution for 5G is still missing. To bridge this gap, we developed ORANSlice, an open-source network slicing-enabled Open RAN system integrated with popular open-source RAN frameworks. ORANSlice features programmable, 3GPP-compliant RAN slicing and scheduling functionalities. It supports RAN slicing control and optimization via xApps on the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) thanks to an extension of the E2 interface between RIC and RAN, and service models for slicing. We deploy and test ORANSlice on different O-RAN testbeds and demonstrate its capabilities on different use cases, including slice prioritization and minimum radio resource guarantee.},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of wireless communication, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) networks have emerged as a pivotal technology, offering enhanced data rates and spectral efficiency by leveraging multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver. The introduction of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has further revolutionized this domain, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and interoperability through its open interfaces and software-defined approach. This paper presents DRAGON, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework for joint Layer and Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection, tailored for downlink single-user MIMO networks under the O-RAN framework. Our approach is designed to be highly scalable, capable of efficiently managing a large number of configuration options in one-shot prediction, including up to 25 MCS and 4 layer choices. The proposed solution has been rigorously evaluated using an O-RAN-based simulation environment, demonstrating up to an 18\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and achieving a best throughput of 87.4\% when compared to the collected ground-truth dataset. Furthermore, our method supports real-time prediction, making it viable for practical deployment. In addition to these advancements, we explore the potential integration of our DRL-based solution with real-world platforms and discuss the extension of our approach to handle multi-user (MU) MIMO scenarios, paving the way for broader applications in next-generation wireless networks.},

Specifically, we utilise the foundation model "Neuro-GPT", which was trained on a large open dataset (TUH EEG) with 20,000 EEG recordings. We fine-tune the model for stress detection and evaluate it on a 40-subject open stress dataset. The evaluation results with a fine-tuned Neuro-GPT are promising with an average accuracy of 74.4\% in quantifying "low-stress" and "high-stress". We also conducted experiments to compare the foundation model approach with traditional machine learning methods and highlight several observations for future research in this direction.},

Given that smartphones are the most widely used devices for entertainment, work, and socialization, they present an ideal platform for innovative approaches to journaling. Despite their ubiquity, the potential of using digital phenotyping, a method of unobtrusively collecting data from digital devices to gain insights into psychological and behavioral patterns, for automated journal generation has been largely underexplored. In this study, we propose AutoJournaling, the first-of-its-kind system that automatically generates journals by collecting and analyzing screenshots from smartphones. This system captures life events and corresponding emotions, offering a novel approach to digital phenotyping. We evaluated AutoJournaling by collecting screenshots every 3 seconds from three students over five days, demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. AutoJournaling is the first framework to utilize seamlessly collected screenshots for journal generation, providing new insights into psychological states through digital phenotyping.},

abstract = {Healthcare monitoring is crucial for early detection, timely intervention, and the ongoing management of health conditions, ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in supporting healthcare tasks. However, existing LLM-based healthcare solutions typically rely on cloud-based systems, which raise privacy concerns and increase the risk of personal information leakage. As a result, there is growing interest in running these models locally on devices like mobile phones and wearables to protect users' privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs) are potential candidates to solve privacy and computational issues, as they are more efficient and better suited for local deployment. However, the performance of SLMs in healthcare domains has not yet been investigated. This paper examines the capability of SLMs to accurately analyze health data, such as steps, calories, sleep minutes, and other vital statistics, to assess an individual's health status. Our results show that, TinyLlama, which has 1.1 billion parameters, utilizes 4.31 GB memory, and has 0.48s latency, showing the best performance compared other four state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLMs on various healthcare applications. Our results indicate that SLMs could potentially be deployed on wearable or mobile devices for real-time health monitoring, providing a practical solution for efficient and privacy-preserving healthcare.},

abstract = {Automated spectrum monitoring necessitates the accurate detection of low probability of intercept (LPI) radio frequency (RF) anomaly signals to identify unwanted interference in wireless networks. However, detecting these unforeseen low-power RF signals is fundamentally challenging due to the scarcity of labeled RF anomaly data. In this paper, we introduce WANDA (Wireless ANomaly Detection Algorithm), an automated framework designed to detect LPI RF anomaly signals in low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) environments without relying on labeled data. WANDA operates through a two-step process: (i) Information extraction, where a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing soft Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'{e}nyi correlation (HGR) as the loss function extracts informative features from RF spectrograms; and (ii) Anomaly detection, where the extracted features are applied to a one-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier to infer RF anomalies. To validate the effectiveness of WANDA, we present a case study focused on detecting unknown Bluetooth signals within the WiFi spectrum using a practical dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that WANDA outperforms other methods in detecting anomaly signals across a range of SIR values (-10 dB to 20 dB).},

abstract = {In this paper, we address task-oriented (or goal-oriented) communications where an encoder at the transmitter learns compressed latent representations of data, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder performs a machine learning task, specifically for classifying the received signals. The deep neural networks corresponding to the encoder-decoder pair are jointly trained, taking both channel and data characteristics into account. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy in completing the underlying task while minimizing the number of channel uses determined by the encoder's output size. To this end, we propose a multi-round, multi-task learning (MRMTL) approach for the dynamic update of channel uses in multi-round transmissions. The transmitter incrementally sends an increasing number of encoded samples over the channel based on the feedback from the receiver, and the receiver utilizes the signals from a previous round to enhance the task performance, rather than only considering the latest transmission. This approach employs multi-task learning to jointly optimize accuracy across varying number of channel uses, treating each configuration as a distinct task. By evaluating the confidence of the receiver in task decisions, MRMTL decides on whether to allocate additional channel uses in multiple rounds. We characterize both the accuracy and the delay (total number of channel uses) of MRMTL, demonstrating that it achieves the accuracy close to that of conventional methods requiring large numbers of channel uses, but with reduced delay by incorporating signals from a prior round. We consider the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural network architectures, and AWGN and Rayleigh channel models for performance evaluation. Our results show that MRMTL significantly improves the efficiency of task-oriented communications, balancing accuracy and latency effectively.},

abstract = {Multimodal Federated Learning (FL) integrates two crucial research areas in IoT scenarios: utilizing complementary multimodal data to enhance downstream inference performance and conducting decentralized training to safeguard privacy. However, existing studies primarily focus on applying FL methods after multimodal feature fusion, without fundamentally addressing multimodal FL across both feature and sample spaces. A notable tradeoff persists between the computational demands of multimodal information and the limited computing resources in IoT systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Joint Horizontal and Vertical (JHV) FL algorithm tailored for multimodal IoT systems. JHV employs vertical FL to distribute computing tasks across multimodal IoT devices (feature space) and horizontal FL to allocate tasks across multiple silos (sample space). Experimental results on two public multimodal datasets show that JHV outperforms three baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for multimodal IoT systems, especially in rapid and accurate downstream tasks like classification and prediction.},

abstract = {Cellular service providers (CSPs) aim to optimize network performance and enhance user experience by tuning network configurations. However, this process often requires continuous live network testing, which incurs significant operational costs. In this paper, we focus on predicting the impact of configuration changes using historical data, thereby reducing the need for live network tests. A key challenge in developing such a model is accounting for unobserved external factors (e.g., weather, referred to as latents) that can introduce confounding effects between configurations and performance metrics. To address this, we employ intermediate network metrics, called Mobility, Access, and Traffic (MAT) metrics, which are influenced by both configurations and latents, and in turn, affect performance metrics. We introduce Configuration Impact Prediction Analysis Toolkit (CIPAT), a novel two-stage toolkit developed using a comprehensive real-world dataset from live LTE networks. Our evaluation demonstrates that CIPAT enables CSPs to predict the performance impact of proposed configuration changes with up to 86\% accuracy and 85\% efficacy, thereby reducing the operational costs associated with configuration tuning.},

abstract = {As a new federated learning(FL) paradigm, clustered federated learning (CFL) could effectively address the issue of model training accuracy loss due to different data distribution in FL. However, the introduction of the clustering process also brings new risks. Adversaries can implement model poisoning by adding crafted perturbations with clients' model parameters, potentially resulting in overall clustering failure. To tackle this problem, we propose a client detection and parameter correction framework in this paper. Our approach aims to identify malicious clients by analyzing the difference in vector parameter density distribution between malicious and benign clients. We precisely locate malicious perturbations in the parameters and recover them, enabling the server to effectively utilize benign updates for normal clustering and training within the CFL framework. Experiment results show that our defense algorithm outperforms others, consistently improving training accuracy by an average of 30\% under various kinds of attacks.},

UAVs present a unique challenge for RF fingerprinting due to their hovering motion, which creates more diverse signal domains compared to other RF devices like Wi-Fi. This results in a severe domain shift problem, where well-trained models struggle to generalize to unseen domains. To address this issue without incurring significant costs in data collection and model retraining, we employ PTNs, a few-shot learning paradigm that enhances cross-domain performance and system viability. We further improve our method's effectiveness by incorporating fine-tuning with data augmentation, maintaining system viability while improving performance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates domain shift, achieving up to a 20\% improvement in cross-domain accuracy for UAV fingerprinting.},

abstract = {In wireless communications, collaborative spectrum sensing is a process that leverages radio frequency (RF) data from multiple RF sensors to make more informed decisions and lower the overall risk of failure in distributed settings. However, most research in collaborative sensing focuses on homogeneous systems using identical sensors, which would not be the case in a real world wireless setting. Instead, due to differences in physical location, each RF sensor would see different versions of signals propagating in the environment, establishing the need for heterogeneous collaborative spectrum sensing. Hence, this paper explores the implementation of collaborative spectrum sensing across heterogeneous sensors, with sensor fusion occurring in the cloud for optimal decision making. We investigate three different machine learning-based fusion methods and test the fused model's ability to perform modulation classification, with a primary goal of optimizing for network bandwidth in regard to next-generation network applications. Our analysis demonstrates that our fusion process is able to optimize the number of features extracted from the heterogeneous sensors according to their varying performance limitations, simulating adverse conditions in a real-world wireless setting.},

abstract = {Next-generation Wi-Fi networks employ large signal bandwidth to meet the demands of high data rates, which poses challenges to Wi-Fi monitoring systems that typically rely on a full sampling rate receiver (RX) to capture signals at full bandwidth for demodulation and decoding. Interestingly, preambles of Wi-Fi packets contain unencrypted information that can be decoded to extract Wi-Fi Physical (PHY) layer information such as modulation and coding scheme (MCS), transmission time, and PHY service data unit (PSDU) length. In this paper, we propose DeepMon, which leverages low-cost RXs operating at sub-Nyquist sampling rates and deep learning (DL) to identify the Wi-Fi protocol and decode PHY layer packet properties from the Wi-Fi preamble. To evaluate DeepMon, we use PlutoSDR as the low sampling rate RX to collect a dataset of over 390K real-world 802.11a/n/ac Wi-Fi packets for the DL model training and testing. Our experiments show that for Wi-Fi packets with up to 160 MHz bandwidth, an RX running DeepMon at 3 MHz sampling rate (i.e., a downsampling ratio of >50\texttimes{}) can achieve an average bit decoding accuracy of 96.20\% for the legacy signal field, corresponding to a mean absolute error of only 0.077 ms for predicting the packet transmission time.},

abstract = {Use cases for network determinism may involve the traversal of multiple network domains. A typical example is the edge-cloud virtualization of the controllers for industrial automation, where the end-to-end data path may include a private mobile network and a wired local-area network within the factory premises, a public transport network between the factory and the edge-cloud data center, and a switching fabric within the same data center. Maintaining deterministic guarantees throughout these domains, likely operated by different providers, is a daunting task when each domain relies on its own control and data-plane technologies for satisfaction of its allocated portion of the end-to-end requirements. We propose a universal model for determinism in wired packet networks that simplifies the realization of deterministic services over chains of network domains. The model builds on a novel traffic shaper where routing information constrains the packet scheduling decisions. The shaper, and therefore the provisioning of resources for every deterministic service, is only needed at the ingress edge of each wired domain. We conjecture perdomain latency bounds enforced by the shaper and corroborate them with experimental evidence. The bounds are easy to combine for multi-domain network paths.},

Integrating digital twins into 6G enables precise orchestration and optimization of network resources, meeting the diverse and stringent demands of next-generation applications. Furthermore, digital twins provide a platform for continuous learning and AI-driven analysis.

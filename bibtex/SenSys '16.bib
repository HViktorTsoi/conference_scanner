abstract = {The consumer electronics industry is witnessing a surge in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ranging from mundane artifacts to complex biosensors connected across disparate networks. As the demand for IoT devices grows, the need for stronger authentication and access control mechanisms is greater than ever. Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span. Primarily, AoT relies on Identity- and Attribute-Based Cryptography to cryptographically enforce Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Additionally, AoT facilitates secure (in terms of stronger authentication) wireless interoperability of new and guest devices in a seamless manner. To validate our solution, we have developed AoT for Android smartphones like the LG G4 and evaluated all the cryptographic primitives over more constrained devices like the Intel Edison and the Arduino Due. This included the implementation of an Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) scheme. Our results indicate AoT ranges from highly efficient on resource-rich devices to affordable on resource-constrained IoT-like devices. Typically, an ABS generation takes around 27 ms on the LG G4, 282 ms on the Intel Edison, and 1.5 s on the Arduino Due.},

abstract = {This paper presents an architecture for a discrete, high-entropy hardware random number generator. Because it is constructed out of simple hardware components, its operation is transparent and auditable. Using avalanche noise, a non-deterministic physical phenomenon, the circuit is inherently probabilistic and resists adversarial control. Furthermore, because it compares the outputs from two matched noise sources, it rejects environmental disturbances like RF energy and power supply ripple. The resulting hardware produces more than 0.98 bits of entropy per sample, is inexpensive, has a small footprint, and can be disabled to conserve power when not in use.},

abstract = {Forming secure pairing between wearable devices has become an important problem in many scenarios, such as mobile payments and private data transmission. This paper presents EMG-KEY, a system that can securely pair wearable devices by leveraging the electrical activity caused by human muscle contraction, that is, Electromyogram (EMG), to generate a secret key. Such a key can then be used by devices to authenticate each other's physical proximity and communicate confidentially. Extensive evaluation on 10 volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that our system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a matching probability of 88.84\%. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrate our system is secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture and imitate legitimate pairing process with the help of camera.},

abstract = {Nowadays, auto insurance companies set personalized insurance rate based on data gathered directly from their customers' cars. In this paper, we show such a personalized insurance mechanism -- wildly adopted by many auto insurance companies -- is vulnerable to exploit. In particular, we demonstrate that an adversary can leverage off-the-shelf hardware to manipulate the data to the device that collects drivers' habits for insurance rate customization and obtain a fraudulent insurance discount. In response to this type of attack, we also propose a defense mechanism that escalates the protection for insurers' data collection. The main idea of this mechanism is to augment the insurer's data collection device with the ability to gather unforgeable data acquired from the physical world, and then leverage these data to identify manipulated data points. Our defense mechanism leveraged a statistical model built on unmanipulated data and is robust to manipulation methods that are not foreseen previously. We have implemented this defense mechanism as a proof-of-concept prototype and tested its effectiveness in the real world. Our evaluation shows that our defense mechanism exhibits a false positive rate of 0.032 and a false negative rate of 0.013.},

abstract = {Opportunistic routing protocols tackle the problem of efficient data collection in dynamic wireless sensor networks, where the radio is duty-cycled to save energy and the topology changes unpredictably due to node mobility and/or link dynamics. Unlike protocols that maintain a routing structure, in opportunistic protocols nodes forward packets to any neighbor that wakes up first, reducing latency and energy costs and increasing the resilience to network dynamics.We claim the performance of existing opportunistic routing protocols can be improved while retaining their resilience by harnessing the synergy between duty cycling and opportunistic forwarding. To prove this claim, we present Staffetta, the first practical duty-cycle adaptation scheme for opportunistic low-power wireless protocols. Staffetta dynamically adapts each node's wake-up frequency to its current forwarding cost, so nodes closer to the sink become more active than nodes farther away. In this way, Staffetta biases the forwarding choices toward the sink as the neighbor waking up first is also likely to offer high routing progress. Experiments on two testbeds with four different opportunistic routing mechanisms demonstrate that Staffetta achieves severalfold performance improvements compared with a fixed wake-up frequency. As a case a point, Staffetta enables ORW, the state-of-the-art opportunistic routing protocol, to reduce end-to-end packet latency by 79-452 \texttimes{} and energy consumption by 2.75-9\texttimes{} while increasing packet delivery ratio compared with ORW's default link-layer settings.},

abstract = {We propose a new class of wireless transmission schemes decoupling synchronization headers from payloads to create new transmission primitives involving a second sender. By transmitting a synchronization header only we can let nearby nodes receive fragments of a packet without having to receive that packet's synchronization header, and by using the capture effect we can overwrite portions of the payload of longer ongoing packets.We explore two scenarios potentially benefiting from such schemes. A) First, we consider crossing a network chasm over which all links are of poor quality: by broadcasting a fabricated packet header on the receiving side of the chasm all receiving nodes are informed to record the packet to the best of their ability. B) Second, we investigate the insertion of short high-priority packets into longer lower-priority transmissions from a different sender. This has the advantage that high-priority senders do not need to wait for the medium to become free but can begin sending at once, while receivers lose only the affected portion of their already incoming low-priority packets.Further, we examine two techniques to reduce the amount of symbol decoding errors caused by using a mismatching synchronization header: 1) careful transmission timing and 2) correction of deterministic symbol decoding errors. In scenario A) these techniques improve the chance of every part of a packet being received successfully by some node on the receiving side of the chasm from 5\% to up to 30\%. In scenario B) we reach successful decoding of the injected packet in up to 70\% of cases.In proof of concept implementations on a testbed of TelosB nodes we confirm the soundness of our methods.},

abstract = {Data prediction in wireless sensor networks replaces the commonly used (periodic) data reporting with a model, updated (infrequently) at the sink to accurately reproduce real data trends. This technique abates up to 99\% of application messages; yet, recent work has shown it achieves "only" up to a 7x lifetime improvement when executed atop a mainstream network stack (e.g., CTP + BoX-MAC), as the idle listening and topology maintenance in the latter are ill-suited to the sparse traffic induced by data prediction. This paper presents a novel network stack designed for data prediction, CRYSTAL, that exploits synchronous transmissions to quickly and reliably transmit model updates when these occur (infrequently but often concurrently), and minimizes overhead during the (frequent) periods with no updates. Based on 90-node experiments in the Indriya testbed and with 7 public datasets, we show that CRYSTAL unleashes the full potential of data prediction, achieving per-mille duty cycle with perfect reliability and very small latency.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the design and implementation of low-- energy tokens for smart interaction with capacitive touch-- enabled devices by associating the token's identity with its contact, or touch. The proposed token's design features two key novel technical components: (1) a through--touch--sensor low--energy communication method for token identification and (2) a touch--sensor energy harvesting technique. The communication mechanism involves the token transmitting its identity (ID) directly through the touch--sensor by artificially modifying the effective capacitance between the touch-- sensor and token surfaces. This approach consumes significantly lower energy compared to traditional electrical signal modulation approaches. By enabling the token to harvest energy from touch--screen sensors or touch--surfaces the token is rendered battery--free. Through experimental evaluations using a prototype implementation, the proposed design is shown to achieve at least 95\% identification accuracy. It is also shown to consume less energy than competitive techniques (NFC P2P and Bluetooth Low--Energy) for communicating a short ID sequence. The adoption of this technology among users is evaluated through a user study on 12 subjects.},

By listening to the sound of the intensity modulated light or electromagnetic wave with different wavelengths, our mobile photoacoustic sensing system captures unique spectra produced by the transmitted and scattered light while passing through various liquid food. As different liquid foods with different chemical compositions yield uniquely different spectral signatures, Nutrilyzer's signal processing and machine learning algorithm learn to map the photoacoustic signature to various liquid food characteristics including nutrients and adulterants. We evaluated Nutrilyzer for milk nutrient prediction (i.e., milk protein) and milk adulterant detection. We have also explored Nutrilyzer for alcohol concentration prediction. The Nutrilyzer mobile system consists of an array of 16 LEDs in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared region, two piezoelectric sensors and an ARM microcontroller unit, which are designed and fabricated in a printed circuit board and a 3D printed photoacoustic housing.},

abstract = {We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median ranging error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband radios. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks.},

abstract = {Driven by the proliferation of sensor-rich mobile devices, crowd sensing has emerged as a new paradigm of gathering information about the physical world. In crowd sensing applications, user observations are usually unevenly distributed across the monitored entities, and this gives rise to two major challenges -- redundancy and sparsity. On one hand, multiple users may observe the same entity, and their observations are sometimes conflicting with each other due to the unreliable nature of human-carried sensors. On the other hand, crowd sensing data are usually very sparse, and there may exist considerable number of entities that never receive any observations from users. Some existing work studies these two challenges separately. However, we can gain great benefits by dealing with them jointly. In this paper, we develop an integrated framework to estimate the true values of entities from redundant and sparse data in crowd sensing applications. In this framework, we propose an effective algorithm to infer the "missing" observations for each entity, and aggregate both user-contributed and inferred observations to discover the true values of entities. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world crowd sensing systems to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework on correctly inferring entity truths from redundant and sparse data.},

abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized the way sensor data are analyzed and interpreted. The accuracy gains these approaches offer make them attractive for the next generation of mobile, wearable and embedded sensory applications. However, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms typically require a significant amount of device and processor resources, even just for the inference stages that are used to discriminate high-level classes from low-level data. The limited availability of memory, computation, and energy on mobile and embedded platforms thus pose a significant challenge to the adoption of these powerful learning techniques. In this paper, we propose SparseSep, a new approach that leverages the sparsification of fully connected layers and separation of convolutional kernels to reduce the resource requirements of popular deep learning algorithms. As a result, SparseSep allows large-scale DNNs and CNNs to run efficiently on mobile and embedded hardware with only minimal impact on inference accuracy. We experiment using SparseSep across a variety of common processors such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, ARM Cortex M0 and M3, and Nvidia Tegra K1, and show that it allows inference for various deep models to execute more efficiently; for example, on average requiring 11.3 times less memory and running 13.3 times faster on these representative platforms.},

abstract = {We present Monoxalyze, a keychain-sized, Bluetooth-based, carbon monoxide breathalyzer that aims to enable mobile, scalable smoking cessation intervention programs. These intervention programs have been shown to greatly increase the rate of a quit attempt, which in turn decreases the rate of smoking, a major public health problem that still affects over one billion people around the world. Currently, intervention programs verify cessation compliance by requiring program participants to periodically visit clinics and exhale through large, expensive carbon monoxide breathalyzers---a practice that cannot scale to one billion smokers. Monoxalyze enables mobile cessation verification by working with a user's smartphone to establish a ring of spatio-temporal transitive trust between the Monoxalyze device, the user, and the smartphone, a concept that can be applied to many third-party monitoring applications. In Monoxalyze, the links of this trust are represented by simultaneous exhalation verification, facial recognition, and device-to-phone visible light authentication. In our evaluation, we show that Monoxalyze lasts over 80 days between charges, and has the ability to verify a Monoxalyze user. With a small user study we show that Monoxalyze determines smoking cessation with 92\% accuracy, a level comparable with commercial CO breathalyzers. Further contributions describe the design decisions behind creating a low-power BLE device.},

abstract = {Daily toothbrushing is essential for maintaining oral health. However, there is very limited technology to monitor the effectiveness of toothbrushing at home. In this paper, a system is built to monitor the brushing quality on all 16 tooth surfaces using a manual toothbrush and an off-the-shelf wrist watch. The toothbrush is modified by attaching small magnets to the handle, so that its orientation and motion can be captured by the magnetic sensor in the wrist watch. The toothbrushing gestures are recognized based on inertial sensing data from the wrist watch. As the acoustic signal collected from the watch is correlated with the motion of toothbrushing stroke, acoustic sensing algorithm is designed to assist in recognition. User-specific toothbrushing order is also utilized to improve the surface recognition. In extensive experiments with 12 users over 3 weeks, our system successfully recognized toothbrushing gestures with an average precision of 85.6\%.},

abstract = {Wearable technology enables a range of exciting new applications in health, commerce, and beyond. For many important applications, wearables must have battery life measured in weeks or months, not hours and days as in most current devices. Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long battery life but with the flexibility and security to support multiple applications. To achieve long battery life with a workload comprising apps from multiple developers, these platforms must have robust mechanisms for app isolation and developer tools for optimizing resource usage.We introduce the Amulet Platform for constrained wearable devices, which includes an ultra-low-power hardware architecture and a companion software framework, including a highly efficient event-driven programming model, low-power operating system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile time. We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware and software, and show how the framework enables developers to write energy-efficient applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lasting weeks or even months, depending on the application, and our interactive resource-profiling tool predicts battery lifetime within 6-10\% of the measured lifetime.},

A supervised non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to adaptively analyze and extract these bioelectrical signals from a single mixed in-ear channel collected by the sensor is also proposed. While LIBS can enable a wide class of low-cost self-care, human computer interaction, and health monitoring applications, we demonstrate its medical potential by developing an autonomous whole-night sleep staging system utilizing LIBS's outputs. We constructed a hardware prototype from off-the-shelf electronic components and used it to conduct 38 hours of sleep studies on 8 participants over a period of 30 days. Our evaluation results show that LIBS can monitor biosignals representing brain activities, eye movements, and muscle contractions with excellent fidelity such that it can be used for sleep stage classification with an average of more than 95\% accuracy.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that it is possible to enable the BLE to WiFi cross-technology communication while supporting the concurrent BLE to BLE and WiFi to WiFi communications. We conducted extensive experiments under different real-world settings and results show that its throughput is more than 85X times higher than the most recently reported cross-technology communication system [22], which only supports one-way communication (i.e., broadcasting) at any specific time.},

With HitchHike, a low power tag reflects existing 802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter, and the backscattered signals can then be decoded as a standard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. Hitch-Hike's key invention is a novel technique called codeword translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around 200Kbps.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face significant scalability challenges due to the proliferation of wide-area wireless monitoring and control systems that require thousands of sensors to be connected over long distances. Due to their short communication range, existing WSN technologies such as those based on IEEE 802.15.4 form many-hop mesh networks complicating the protocol design and network deployment. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable sensor network architecture - called Sensor Network Over White Spaces (SNOW) - by exploiting the TV white spaces. Many WSN applications need low data rate, low power operation, and scalability in terms of geographic areas and the number of nodes. The long communication range of white space radios significantly increases the chances of packet collision at the base station. We achieve scalability and energy efficiency by splitting channels into narrowband orthogonal subcarriers and enabling packet receptions on the subcarriers in parallel with a single radio. The physical layer of SNOW is designed through a distributed implementation of OFDM that enables distinct orthogonal signals from distributed nodes. Its MAC protocol handles subcarrier allocation among the nodes and transmission scheduling. We implement SNOW in GNU radio using USRP devices. Experiments demonstrate that it can correctly decode in less than 0.1ms multiple packets received in parallel at different subcarriers, thus drastically enhancing the scalability of WSN.},

In parallel to ultra-low currents and high dynamic range measurements, novel applications require mobile measurements for easy in-situ characterization or wearable device testing. The RocketLogger is a solution that fulfills these requirements. While being fully mobile, it measures currents from 5 nA up to 500 mA with very fast and seamless range-switching.

The camera used has a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps), so in conventional fashion, it is incapable to detain significant information about any vibration frequency which is not in the range of Nyquist theory of frequency (within a range of ±15 Hz). We have solved the challenge using optical strobing phenomena for capturing modulo (of division) between object's frequency and strobing frequency using camera. Motion in the video is tracked by conventional image processing technique. Finally, object vibration is calculated from the frequency plot and optical strobing frequency. Under most of the cases, the application estimates vibration frequency values, within a range of ±1.5\% of error.},

Wheeled robots, usually employed for such tasks, strive to adapt to the wide range of environments where WSNs are deployed, from chaotic office spaces to neatly raked potato fields. For this reason, wheeled robots often require an expensive customization step in order to adapt, for example, their localization and navigation systems to the specific environment. To avoid this issue, we present Gondola, a parametric robot infrastructure based on pulling wires, rather than wheels. Gondola avoids the most common problems of wheeled robots and easily adapts to many WSNs' scenarios. Different from existing solutions, Gondola can easily move in 3-dimensional space, with no need of a complex localization system and with an accuracy that is comparable to off-the-shelf traditional robots.},

However, current visible light localization schemes rely on either energy-hungry cameras or assumptions about channel responses of light sources, which limits their application. They also require LED lights with specialized circuitry, which increases cost and hinders large scale deployment. We present LiTell2, a scheme that extracts unique features from incumbent fluorescent or LED lights, and uses a simple photodiode sensor to extract AoA information for localization. LiTell2's sensor achieves AoA measurements by leveraging the diversity of photodiodes' angular responses. By comparing signal from photodiodes of different angular response, LiTell2 can derive AoA of each light source, thus achieving high precision localization with unmodified light fixtures and extremely low fingerprinting cost. Our experiments show that LiTell2 provides accurate AoA sensing and enables energy efficient yet robust localization.},

Accordingly, NFC can be optionally utilized when secure data are transmitted in various services and applications focusing on ID validation. This demo presents a proof-of-concept for an alternative packet transmission method for achieving secure data exchange based on IP-over-NFC technology. For realizing this, there are a number of technical challenges. Utmost, the current NFC Linux kernel driver requires updates for supporting network-layer functionalities.

We have developed Talos further to enable encrypted data sharing, such that users can securely share their homomorphically encrypted data with add-on services and other users. We demonstrate a prototype implementation of a real-world application utilizing Talos. Talos enables applications to efficiently store and interact with encrypted sensory data in the cloud. With our prototype application, we show that with Talos in place the user experience remains unchanged (i.e., response time below 1 s) although all operations over data in the cloud incorporate encrypted data processing. Moreover, we demonstrate how Talos can be smoothly integrated into IoT apps (currently supporting Contiki and Android). Hence, we hope to encourage the development of secure IoT applications on top of the Talos framework.},

abstract = {For the last fifteen years, research explored the hardware, software, sensing, communication abstractions, languages, and protocols that could make networks of small, embedded devices---motes---sample and report data for long periods of time while unattended. Today, the application and technological landscapes have shifted, introducing new requirements and new capabilities. Hardware has evolved past 8 and 16 bit microcontrollers: there are now 32 bit processors with lower energy budgets and greater computing capability. New wireless link layers have emerged, creating protocols that support direct interaction with users, but introduce novel limitations that systems must consider. Programming language advances have led to the ability to write system kernels that guarantee safety and reliability while maintaining low overhead. The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of motes. We look towards new technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex M processors, and capable multi-process operating systems, with new application spaces such as personal area networks, and new capabilities and requirements in security and privacy to inform contemporary hardware and software platforms. It is time for a new, open experimental platform in this post-mote era.},

abstract = {Telepresence technology enables users to be virtually present in another location at the same time through video streaming. This kind of user interaction is further enhanced through mobility by driving remotely to form what is called a Telepresence robot. These innovative machines connect individuals with restricted mobility and increase social interaction, collaboration and active participation. However, operating and navigating these robots by individuals who have little knowledge and map of the remote environment is challenging. Avoiding obstacles via the narrow camera view and manual remote operation is a cumbersome task. Moreover, the users lack the sense of immersion while they are busy maneuvering via the real-time video feed and, thereby, decreasing their capability to handle different tasks. This demo presents a simultaneous mapping and autonomous driving virtual reality robot. Leveraging the 2D Lidar sensor, we generate two dimensional occupancy grid maps via SLAM and provide assisted navigation in reducing the onerous task of avoiding obstacles. The attitude of the robotic head with a camera is remotely controlled via the virtual reality headset. Remote users will be able to gain a visceral understanding of the environment while teleoperating the robot.},

abstract = {We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median range error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks.This demo complements the paper "SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization" to be presented at SenSys'16.},

abstract = {The era of city-scale sensing is dawning. Supported by new sensing capabilities, the capability to detect and measure phenomena throughout a large area will allow deeper insight and understanding into how cities work. The challenge of city-scale sensing is not limited to developing new sensing applications, however. A sensor must be installed in a location. It must be provided power, storage, and communications. All these tasks stand aside from the desired sensing effort, but are necessary nevertheless.In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular, city-scale sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform, designed to be physically attached to sign posts throughout a city, reduces the burden for sensor and application developers by providing the necessary resources to modules attached to it. Power is provided by harvesting from solar panels with battery storage, with each module allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost platform also provides data storage, long-range communication, data processing, module isolation, and an installation point for connected modules. The signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and RF spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.},

abstract = {Smart homes will compose of multiple sensors that will sense, compute and transmit information to a central cloud, all of which are energy consuming tasks. We propose to demonstrate a software-defined solution for wirelessly charging these sensors using RF energy, thereby extending their lifetimes. In our demo, the actions of more than one energy transmitter (ET) are synchronized in phase and frequency in real time using periodic feedback from the target sensor, but without any common clock reference. The controller selects the optimal subset of ETs to satisfy the energy request from a given sensor, which cooperatively beamform RF energy towards that sensor. Our software-defined framework, implemented in Python, allows the central controller to automatically discover the installed sensors, obtain energy needs, and schedule charging tasks in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner that allows the network to scale. The demonstration includes advancements in design and fabrication of RF energy harvesting circuits that interface with the TI EZ430 sensors, implementation of a software-defined control and data plane, as well as a real-time distributed beamforming algorithm on USRP radios that results in a battery-free network of sensors.},

Leveraging on the excellent testbeds and tools that have been built to support experimental validation, we make the case for a reference benchmark to promote a fair comparison and reproducibility of results.

In an attempt to reduce the energy cost of this data offloading operation, we propose SparseGPS+. Based on the sparse decomposition model, it overcomes many limitations of SparseGPS [1] to yield better signal-to-noise ratio and detection accuracy; which translates to 30\% more energy savings compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recent studies on CTC (cross-technology communication) have demonstrated the possibility of building direct communication between heterogeneous wireless communication technologies, such as WiFi and ZigBee. However, current solutions suffer from significant spectrum usage or limited throughput. To address the issues, this paper presents Transparent Cross-technology Communication (TCTC), a novel CTC technique that establishes a side channel by exploiting today's abundant wireless traffic. The key idea of TCTC is to embed messages in the timings of on-going legacy traffic (e.g., HTTP packets in WiFi), with small and bounded impact on upper-layer applications. Feasibility and effectiveness of our design has been validated via test-bed implementations and experiments on bidirectional communication between WiFi and ZigBee platforms.},

abstract = {Diaries are used to record aspects of lives --- activities, events, experiences, feelings, thoughts, and physiological measures. Smart diaries can reduce the user's burden by automatically registering some of these aspects. Existing systems have two weaknesses: (a) they are not extensible, and (b) their design is not theory-driven. We introduce LifeMaps, a cloud-based automated, extensible, theory-driven smart diary. Because it is inspired by theory, "The Deep Structures of Lives," it organizes data to conform to the way we experience our lives and may lead a deeper understanding of lives.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is the primary cause of recent increases in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases that place an untenable strain on healthcare and public health. One of the primary behavioral causes, i.e. dietary intake, is a behavior that science has had little success in understanding, much less affecting. Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED) have high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake and obesity rates. In contrast to traditional obesity related approaches that focus on dietary intakes (e.g., what and how much is being eaten), FED based approaches focus on family mealtime and home food environment (e.g., who is eating, when, where, with whom, interpersonal stress) for modeling behavior and providing feedback that has potential for successful behavior modification. This poster briefly presents M2FED, an integrated system for monitoring and modeling FED. The system is under development, and it consists of in-situ and wearable sensors, and smartphones that collect synchronized real-time FED data used to iteratively develop dynamic, contextualized FED models.},

abstract = {Many researches have shown that concurrent transmission (CT) helps to improve the energy efficiency and latency of 2.4GHz IEEE-802.15.4-based multi-hop networks. However, it has been shown that the success of CT in IEEE 802.15.4 is mainly due to the DSSS. In view of the great potential of long range sub-GHz technologies for future smart meter applications, we assess the feasibility of applying CT to non-DSSS sub-GHz receivers. In this work, we evaluate the FSK-based receiver performance in the critical case - the scenario that concurrent transmitted signals are received with the same power such so the mutual interference become worst. Our evaluations are based on the 2-FSK mode of TI CC1120 chips. The results show that the basic 2-FSK mode is vulnerable to CT. On the other hand, if the FEC and the interleaver are adopted, the receiver can survive in the heavy interfering region as long as the timing offset is smaller than 1 μs and the CFO is larger than 5 KHz.},

Designing practical distributed CPS controllers often benefits from a logically centralized approach, where each node computes the control law locally based on global knowledge of the system state. We present Mixer, an all-to-all communication scheme that enables all nodes in a multi-hop low-power wireless network to exchange sizable packets with one another. Mixer's design integrates synchronous transmissions with random linear network coding, harnessing the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. Results from testbed experiments with an early Mixer prototype show that our design reduces latency by 1.1-2.6\texttimes{} for 16-96-byte packets compared with the state of the art, while providing a reliability above 99.9\% in most settings we test.},

This research focuses on implementing and deploying a system using Contiki, 6LoWPAN over an 868 MHz radio network, together with CoAP as a standard application layer protocol. A system was deployed in the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland as an environmental sensor network, measuring streams, temperature profiles in peat and periglacial features. It was found that RPL provided an effective routing algorithm, and that the use of UDP packets with CoAP proved to be an energy efficient application layer. This combination of technologies can be very effective in large area sensor networks.},

To solve current deficiencies in multi-hop mesh network and cross-domain network design, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed "edge router" incorporates these two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both high-throughput Internet and resilient sensor coverage throughout the community.},

Using mobile devices as sensors has the advantage that users do not have to purchase or manage additional sensing devices within the home. Among the different sensor modalities discussed in [4, 1, 2, 5, 3] many of which are limited to detecting a small subset of activities in-home, sound is a highly general and aligns well with everyday human activity. We demonstrate that having access to decibel-level data streams from multiple devices can give us more insight into activity and occupancy patterns than a single sensor, without compromising privacy.},

Such localization is important for many smart building applications, such as efficient building management, senior/health care, and security. Compared to other sensing approaches, footstep-induced vibration provides a sensing system which is sparse and non-intrusive. The main challenge of achieving high accuracy using such approach is frequency-dependent wave propagation characteristics, such as dispersion, in floor structure. These characteristics result in distortions in the shape of signal. To overcome such distortions, we decompose the vibration signals into different frequency components using wavelet transform and focus on specific components in all the sensors. In a set of experiments in a real structure, our approach results in average localization errors of 0.41 meters, a 4.4X reduction compared to a baseline approach using raw data.},
